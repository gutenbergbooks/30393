<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>THE OLD SEA-DOG AT THE &ldquo;ADMIRAL BENBOW&rdquo;</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Squire Trelawney</span>, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these
gentlemen, having asked me to write down the whole particulars
about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the
end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island,
and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted,
I take up my pen in the year of grace 17&mdash;, and go back to
the time when my father kept the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo; inn,
and the brown old seaman, with the sabre-cut, first took up
his lodging under our roof.</p>

<p>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came
plodding to the inn-door, his sea-chest following behind
him in a hand-barrow; a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown
man; his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulders of his soiled
blue coat; his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken
nails; and the sabre-cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid
white. I remember him looking round the cove and
whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in
that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen men on the dead man&rsquo;s chest&mdash;</p>
<p><span style="padding-left: 2em;">Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been
tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped
on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he
carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for
a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste, and still
looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a handy cove,&rdquo; says he, at length; &ldquo;and a
pleasant sittyated grog-shop.&mdash;Much company, mate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My father told him no&mdash;very little company, the more
was the pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is the berth for me.&mdash;Here
you, matey,&rdquo; he cried to the man who trundled the barrow;
&ldquo;bring up alongside and help up my chest. I&rsquo;ll stay here
a bit,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a plain man; rum and bacon
and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch
ships off.&mdash;What you mought call me? You mought call
me captain. Oh, I see what you&rsquo;re at&mdash;there;&rdquo; and he
threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold.
&ldquo;You can tell me when I&rsquo;ve worked through that,&rdquo; says he,
looking as fierce as a commander.</p>

<p>And, indeed, bad as his clothes were, and coarsely as he
spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed
before the mast; but seemed like a mate or skipper, accustomed
to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came
with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the
morning before at the &ldquo;Royal George&rdquo;; that he had inquired
what inns there were along the coast, and hearing
ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had
chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And
that was all we could learn of our guest.</p>

<p>He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung
round the cove, or upon the cliffs, with a brass telescope;
all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire, and
drank rum and water very strong. Mostly he would not
speak when spoken to; only look up sudden and fierce, and
blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people
who came about our house soon learned to let him be.
Every day, when he came back from his stroll, he would ask
if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first
we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that
made him ask this question; but at last we began to see he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman put up at the
&ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo; (as now and then some did, making by
the coast road for Bristol), he would look in at him through
the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he
was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such
was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the
matter; for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had
taken me aside one day, and promised me a silver fourpenny
on the first of every month if I would only keep my &ldquo;weather-eye
open for a seafaring man with one leg,&rdquo; and let him
know the moment he appeared. Often enough, when the
first of the month came round, and I applied to him for my
wage, he would only blow through his nose at me, and stare
me down; but before the week was out he was sure to think
better of it, bring me my fourpenny-piece, and repeat his
orders to look out for &ldquo;the seafaring man with one leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely
tell you. On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four
corners of the house, and the surf roared along the cove and
up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with
a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg would be
cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous
kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and
that in the middle of his body. To see him leap and run
and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares.
And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly
fourpenny-piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.</p>

<p>But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring
man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain
himself than anybody else who knew him. There were
nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his
head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and
sing his wicked old wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but
sometimes he would call for glasses round, and force all the
trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus
to his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with
&ldquo;Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum&rdquo;; all the neighbours joining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each
singing louder than the other, to avoid remark. For in
these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known;
he would slap his hand on the table, for silence all round;
he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes
because none was put, and so he judged the company
was not following his story. Nor would he allow any one
to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled
off to bed.</p>

<p>His stories were what frightened people worst of all.
Dreadful stories they were; about hanging, and walking the
plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild
deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account
he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men
that God ever allowed upon the sea; and the language in
which he told these stories shocked our plain country people
almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father
was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would
soon cease coming there to be tyrannised over and put down,
and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his
presence did us good. People were frightened at the time,
but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine
excitement in a quiet country life; and there was even a
party of the younger men who pretended to admire him,
calling him a &ldquo;true sea-dog,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;real old salt,&rdquo; and
suchlike names, and saying there was the sort of man that
made England terrible at sea.</p>

<p>In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us; for he kept
on staying week after week, and at last month after month,
so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my
father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more.
If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose
so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my
poor father out of the room. I have seen him wringing
his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance
and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his
early and unhappy death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>All the time he lived with us the captain made no change
whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a
hawker. One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he
let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance
when it blew. I remember the appearance of his coat,
which he patched himself up-stairs in his room, and which,
before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote
or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the
neighbours, and with these, for the most part, only when
drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had ever
seen open.</p>

<p>He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end,
when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him
off. Dr. Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient,
took a bit of dinner from my mother, and went into the
parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down
from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old &ldquo;Benbow.&rdquo;
I followed him in, and I remember observing the
contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as
snow, and his bright black eyes and pleasant manners, made
with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy,
heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting far gone
in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he&mdash;the
captain, that is&mdash;began to pipe up his eternal song:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p class="ind03">&ldquo;Fifteen men on the dead man&rsquo;s chest&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!</p>
<p>Drink and the devil had done for the rest&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">At first I had supposed &ldquo;the dead man&rsquo;s chest&rdquo; to be that
identical big box of his up-stairs in the front room, and the
thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of
the one-legged seafaring man. But by this time we had all
long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was
new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I
observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked
up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his
talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually
brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand
upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean&mdash;silence.
The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey&rsquo;s;
he went on as before, speaking clear and kind, and drawing
briskly at his pipe between every word or two. The captain
glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still
harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath:
&ldquo;Silence, there, between decks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you addressing me, sir?&rdquo; says the doctor; and
when the ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this
was so, &ldquo;I have only one thing to say to you, sir,&rdquo; replies
the doctor, &ldquo;that if you keep on drinking rum, the world
will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old fellow&rsquo;s fury was awful. He sprang to his feet,
drew and opened a sailor&rsquo;s clasp-knife, and, balancing it
open on the palm of his hand, threatened to pin the doctor
to the wall.</p>

<p>The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him,
as before, over his shoulder, and in the same tone of voice;
rather high, so that all the room might hear, but perfectly
calm and steady&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket,
I promise, upon my honour, you shall hang at next assizes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then followed a battle of looks between them; but the
captain soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed
his seat, grumbling like a beaten dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;since I now
know there&rsquo;s such a fellow in my district, you may count
I&rsquo;ll have an eye upon you day and night. I&rsquo;m not a doctor
only; I&rsquo;m a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint
against you, if it&rsquo;s only for a piece of incivility like
to-night&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll take effectual means to have you hunted
down and routed out of this. Let that suffice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after Dr. Livesey&rsquo;s horse came to the door, and he
rode away; but the captain held his peace that evening,
and for many evenings to come.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>BLACK DOG APPEARS AND DISAPPEARS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not very long after this that there occurred the first
of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain,
though not, as you will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter
cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it
was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely
to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother and I had
all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough,
without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.</p>

<p>It was one January morning, very early&mdash;a pinching,
frosty morning&mdash;the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple
lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only
touching the hill-tops and shining far to seaward. The
captain had risen earlier than usual, and set out down the
beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the
old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted
back upon his head. I remember his breath hanging like
smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I
heard of him, as he turned the big rock, was a loud snort of
indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr.
Livesey.</p>

<p>Well, mother was up-stairs with father; and I was laying
the breakfast-table against the captain&rsquo;s return, when the
parlour door opened, and a man stepped in on whom I had
never set my eyes before. He was a pale, tallowy creature,
wanting two fingers of the left hand; and, though he wore a
cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I had always
my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I
remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and
yet he had a smack of the sea about him too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would
take rum; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it he
sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near. I
paused where I was with my napkin in my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, sonny,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Come nearer here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took a step nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this here table for my mate Bill?&rdquo; he asked, with a
kind of leer.</p>

<p>I told him I did not know his mate Bill; and this was
for a person who stayed in our house, whom we called the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my mate Bill would be called the
captain, as like as not. He has a cut on one cheek, and a
mighty pleasant way with him, particularly in drink, has
my mate Bill. We&rsquo;ll put it, for argument like, that your
captain has a cut on one cheek&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll put it, if you like,
that that cheek&rsquo;s the right one. Ah, well! I told you.
Now, is my mate Bill in this here house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him he was out walking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when I had pointed out the rock, and told him how
the captain was likely to return, and how soon, and answered
a few other questions,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this&rsquo;ll be as good
as drink to my mate Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expression of his face as he said these words was not
at all pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that
the stranger was mistaken, even supposing he meant what
he said. But it was no affair of mine, I thought; and, besides,
it was difficult to know what to do. The stranger
kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round
the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped
out myself into the road, but he immediately called me back,
and, as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy, a most
horrible change came over his tallowy face, and he ordered
me in, with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I was
back again he returned to his former manner, half-fawning,
half-sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
good boy, and he had taken quite a fancy to me. &ldquo;I have
a son of my own,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as like you as two blocks, and
he&rsquo;s all the pride of my &rsquo;art. But the great thing for boys
is discipline, sonny&mdash;discipline. Now, if you had sailed
along of Bill, you wouldn&rsquo;t have stood there to be spoke to
twice&mdash;not you. That was never Bill&rsquo;s way, nor the way
of sich as sailed with him.&mdash;And here, sure enough, is my
mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm, bless his old &rsquo;art,
to be sure. You and me&rsquo;ll just go back into the parlour,
sonny, and get behind the door, and we&rsquo;ll give Bill a little
surprise&mdash;bless his &rsquo;art, I say again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the
parlour, and put me behind him in the corner, so that we were
both hidden by the open door. I was very uneasy and
alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my fears
to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself.
He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the
blade in the sheath; and all the time we were waiting there
he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump
in the throat.</p>

<p>At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind
him, without looking to the right or left, and marched
straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; said the stranger, in a voice that I thought he
had tried to make bold and big.</p>

<p>The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all
the brown had gone out of his face, and even his nose was
blue; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost, or the
Evil One, or something worse, if anything can be; and, upon
my word, I felt sorry to see him, all in a moment, turn so
old and sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate,
Bill, surely,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>

<p>The captain gave a sort of gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Dog!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who else?&rdquo; returned the other, getting more at his
ease. &ldquo;Black Dog as ever was, come for to see his old ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>mate
Billy, at the &lsquo;Admiral Benbow&rsquo; inn. Ah, Bill, Bill,
we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two
talons,&rdquo; holding up his mutilated hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve run me
down; here I am; well, then, speak up: what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you, Bill,&rdquo; returned Black Dog, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in the
right of it, Billy. I&rsquo;ll have a glass of rum from this dear
child here, as I&rsquo;ve took such a liking to; and we&rsquo;ll sit down,
if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I returned with the rum, they were already seated
on either side of the captain&rsquo;s breakfast-table&mdash;Black Dog
next to the door, and sitting sideways, so as to have one eye
on his old shipmate, and one, as I thought, on his retreat.</p>

<p>He bade me go, and leave the door wide open. &ldquo;None
of your keyholes for me, sonny,&rdquo; he said; and I left them
together, and retired into the bar.</p>

<p>For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen,
I could hear nothing but a low gabbling; but at last the
voices began to grow higher, and I could pick up a word
or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no; and an end of it!&rdquo; he cried once.
And again, &ldquo;If it comes to swinging, swing all, say I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion
of oaths and other noises&mdash;the chair and table went over in a
lump, a clash of steel followed, and then a cry of pain, and
the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight, and the
captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn cutlasses, and the
former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just at the
door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous
cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had
it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral
Benbow. You may see the notch on the lower side of the
frame to this day.</p>

<p>That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon
the road, Black Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful
clean pair of heels, and disappeared over the edge of the
hill in half a minute. The captain, for his part, stood staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he passed
his hand over his eyes several times, and at last turned back
into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;rum;&rdquo; and as he spoke he reeled
a little, and caught himself with one hand against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; cried I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rum,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I must get away from here.
Rum! rum!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ran to fetch it; but I was quite unsteadied by all that
had fallen out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap,
and while I was still getting in my own way, I heard a loud
fall in the parlour, and, running in, beheld the captain lying
full-length upon the floor. At the same instant my mother,
alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running down-stairs
to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing
very loud and hard; but his eyes were closed, and his
face a horrible colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, deary me,&rdquo; cried my mother, &ldquo;what a disgrace
upon the house! And your poor father sick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the
captain, nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt
in the scuffle with the stranger. I got the rum, to be
sure, and tried to put it down his throat; but his teeth were
tightly shut, and his jaws as strong as iron. It was a happy
relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came
in, on his visit to my father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, doctor,&rdquo; we cried, &ldquo;what shall we do? Where
is he wounded?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wounded? A fiddle-stick&rsquo;s end!&rdquo; said the doctor.
&ldquo;No more wounded than you or I. The man has had a
stroke, as I warned him.&mdash;Now, Mrs. Hawkins, just you run
up-stairs to your husband, and tell him, if possible, nothing
about it. For my part, I must do my best to save this
fellow&rsquo;s trebly worthless life; and Jim here will get me a
basin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already
ripped up the captain&rsquo;s sleeve, and exposed his great sinewy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
arm. It was tattooed in several places. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A fair wind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Billy Bones his fancy,&rdquo; were very
neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near
the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging
from it&mdash;done, as I thought, with great spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prophetic,&rdquo; said the doctor, touching this picture with
his finger. &ldquo;And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your
name, we&rsquo;ll have a look at the colour of your blood.&mdash;Jim,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;are you afraid of blood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you hold the basin;&rdquo; and with
that he took his lancet and opened a vein.</p>

<p>A great deal of blood was taken before the captain
opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he
recognised the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his
glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly
his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Black Dog?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no Black Dog here,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;except
what you have on your own back. You have been drinking
rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and
I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you
head-foremost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my name,&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much I care,&rdquo; returned the doctor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the name
of a buccaneer of my acquaintance, and I call you by it for
the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this:
one glass of rum won&rsquo;t kill you, but if you take one you&rsquo;ll
take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don&rsquo;t
break off short, you&rsquo;ll die&mdash;do you understand that?&mdash;die,
and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come,
now, make an effort. I&rsquo;ll help you to your bed for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist
him up-stairs, and laid him on his bed, where his head fell
back on the pillow, as if he were almost fainting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, mind you,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I clear my conscience&mdash;the
name of rum for you is death.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>And with that he went off to see my father, taking me
with him by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is nothing,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he had closed the
door. &ldquo;I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet a
while; he should lie for a week where he is&mdash;that is the best
thing for him and you; but another stroke would settle
him.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE BLACK SPOT</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">About</span> noon I stopped at the captain&rsquo;s door with some
cooling drinks and medicines. He was lying very much as
we had left him, only a little higher, and he seemed both
weak and excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the only one here that&rsquo;s worth
anything; and you know I&rsquo;ve been always good to you.
Never a month but I&rsquo;ve given you a silver fourpenny for
yourself. And now you see, mate, I&rsquo;m pretty low, and
deserted by all; and, Jim, you&rsquo;ll bring me one noggin of
rum, now, won&rsquo;t you, matey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice, but
heartily. &ldquo;Doctors is all swabs,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and that
doctor there, why, what do he know about seafaring men?
I been in places hot as pitch, and mates dropping round with
Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea
with earthquakes&mdash;what do the doctor know of lands like
that?&mdash;and I lived on rum, I tell you. It&rsquo;s been meat and
drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I&rsquo;m not to have my
rum now I&rsquo;m a poor old hulk on a lee-shore, my blood&rsquo;ll be
on you, Jim, and that doctor swab;&rdquo; and he ran on again
for a while with curses. &ldquo;Look, Jim, how my fingers
fidges,&rdquo; he continued, in the pleading tone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep
&rsquo;em still, not I. I haven&rsquo;t had a drop this blessed day.
That doctor&rsquo;s a fool, I tell you. If I don&rsquo;t have a drain o&rsquo;
rum, Jim, I&rsquo;ll have the horrors; I seen some on &rsquo;em already.
I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as plain as
print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I&rsquo;m a man that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
has lived rough, and I&rsquo;ll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself
said one glass wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me. I&rsquo;ll give you a golden
guinea for a noggin, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed
me for my father, who was very low that day, and needed
quiet; besides, I was re-assured by the doctor&rsquo;s words, now
quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer of a bribe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want none of your money,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but what you
owe my father. I&rsquo;ll get you one glass and no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily, and drank
it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s some better, sure enough.
And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie
here in this old berth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week at least,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A week! I can&rsquo;t do that:
they&rsquo;d have the black spot on me by then. The lubbers is
going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment;
lubbers as couldn&rsquo;t keep what they got, and want to nail
what is another&rsquo;s. Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I
want to know? But I&rsquo;m a saving soul. I never wasted
good money of mine; nor lost it neither; and I&rsquo;ll trick &rsquo;em
again. I&rsquo;m not afraid on &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll shake out another reef,
matey, and daddle &rsquo;em again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great
difficulty, holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost
made me cry out, and moving his legs like so much dead
weight. His words, spirited as they were in meaning,
contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which
they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting
position on the edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doctor&rsquo;s done me,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;My ears
is singing. Lay me back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back
again to his former place, where he lay for a while silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;you saw that seafaring man
to-day?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Dog?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Black Dog,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> a bad &rsquo;un; but
there&rsquo;s worse that put him on. Now, if I can&rsquo;t get away
nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it&rsquo;s my
old sea-chest they&rsquo;re after; you get on a horse&mdash;you can,
can&rsquo;t you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to&mdash;well,
yes, I will!&mdash;to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe
all hands&mdash;magistrates and sich&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll lay &rsquo;em aboard
at the &lsquo;Admiral Benbow&rsquo;&mdash;all old Flint&rsquo;s crew, man and
boy, all on &rsquo;em that&rsquo;s left. I was first mate, I was&mdash;old
Flint&rsquo;s first mate, and I&rsquo;m the only one as knows the place.
He gave it me to Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as
if I was to now, you see. But you won&rsquo;t peach unless they
get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog
again, or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim&mdash;him above all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is the black spot, captain?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a summons, mate. I&rsquo;ll tell you if they get that.
But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I&rsquo;ll share with
you equals, upon my honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but
soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a
child, with the remark, &ldquo;If ever a seaman wanted drugs,
it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; he fell at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in
which I left him. What I should have done had all gone
well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole
story to the doctor; for I was in mortal fear lest the captain
should repent of his confessions and make an end of me.
But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly
that evening, which put all other matters on one side. Our
natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the arranging
of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in
the meanwhile, kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to
think of the captain, far less to be afraid of him.</p>

<p>He got down-stairs next morning, to be sure, and had
his meals as usual, though he ate little, and had more, I am
afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself
out of the bar, scowling and blowing through his nose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
no one dared to cross him. On the night before the funeral
he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house
of mourning, to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song;
but, weak as he was, we were all in fear of death for
him, and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case
many miles away, and was never near the house after my
father&rsquo;s death. I have said the captain was weak; and
indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his
strength. He clambered up- and down-stairs, and went
from the parlour to the bar and back again, and sometimes
put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to the
walls as he went for support, and breathing hard and fast
like a man on a steep mountain. He never particularly
addressed me, and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten
his confidences; but his temper was more flighty, and,
allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than ever.
He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing
his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. But,
with all that, he minded people less, and seemed shut up in
his own thoughts and rather wandering. Once, for instance,
to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a different air, a kind
of country love-song, that he must have learned in his youth
before he had begun to follow the sea.</p>

<p>So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and
about three o&rsquo;clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was
standing at the door for a moment, full of sad thoughts about
my father, when I saw some one drawing slowly near along
the road. He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him
with a stick, and wore a great green shade over his eyes and
nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and
wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood, that made
him appear positively deformed. I never saw in my life
a more dreadful-looking figure. He stopped a little from
the inn, and, raising his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed
the air in front of him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will any kind friend inform a blind man, who has lost
the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
native country, England, and God bless King George!&mdash;where
or in what part of this country he may now be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are at the &lsquo;Admiral Benbow,&rsquo; Black Hill Cove,
my good man,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear a voice,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;a young voice. Will you
give me your hand, my kind young friend, and lead me in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless
creature gripped it in a moment like a vice. I was so
much startled that I struggled to withdraw; but the blind
man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take me in to the captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;upon my word I dare not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it! Take me in straight,
or I&rsquo;ll break your arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is for yourself I mean. The captain
is not what he used to be. He sits with a drawn cutlass.
Another gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now, march,&rdquo; interrupted he; and I never
heard a voice so cruel, and cold, and ugly as that blind
man&rsquo;s. It cowed me more than the pain; and I began to
obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and towards
the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting,
dazed with rum. The blind man clung close to me, holding
me in one iron fist, and leaning almost more of his weight
on me than I could carry. &ldquo;Lead me straight up to him,
and when I&rsquo;m in view, cry out, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a friend for you,
Bill.&rsquo; If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll do this;&rdquo; and with that he gave
me a twitch that I thought would have made me faint.
Between this and that, I was so utterly terrified of the blind
beggar that I forgot my terror of the captain, and as I opened
the parlour door, cried out the words he had ordered in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the
rum went out of him, and left him staring sober. The ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>pression
of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal
sickness. He made a movement to rise, but I do not believe
he had enough force left in his body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Bill, sit where you are,&rdquo; said the beggar. &ldquo;If
I can&rsquo;t see, I can hear a finger stirring. Business is business.
Hold out your left hand.&mdash;Boy, take his left hand by the
wrist, and bring it near to my right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass
something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick
into the palm of the captain&rsquo;s, which closed upon it instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now that&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; said the blind man; and at
the words he suddenly left hold of me, and, with incredible
accuracy and nimbleness, skipped out of the parlour and
into the road, where, as I still stood motionless, I could hear
his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance.</p>

<p>It was some time before either I or the captain seemed
to gather our senses; but at length, and about at the same
moment, I released his wrist, which I was still holding,
and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Six hours. We&rsquo;ll do
them yet;&rdquo; and he sprang to his <span class="correction" title="without a period in text">feet.</span></p>

<p>Even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat,
stood swaying for a moment, and then, with a peculiar
sound, fell from his whole height face-foremost to the floor.</p>

<p>I ran to him at once, calling to my mother. But haste
was all in vain. The captain had been struck dead by
thundering apoplexy. It is a curious thing to understand,
for I had certainly never liked the man, though of late I
had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was
dead I burst into a flood of tears. It was the second death
I had known, and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in
my heart.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>THE SEA CHEST</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">I lost</span> no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I
knew, and perhaps should have told her long before, and we
saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position.
Some of the man&rsquo;s money&mdash;if he had any&mdash;was certainly due
to us; but it was not likely that our captain&rsquo;s shipmates,
above all the two specimens seen by me, Black Dog and the
blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in
payment of the dead man&rsquo;s debts. The captain&rsquo;s order to
mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left
my mother alone and unprotected, which was not to be
thought of. Indeed, it seemed impossible for either of us
to remain much longer in the house: the fall of coals in the
kitchen-grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled us with
alarms. The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted
by approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body
of the captain on the parlour floor, and the thought of that
detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand, and ready
to return, there were moments when, as the saying goes, I
jumped in my skin for terror. Something must speedily
be resolved upon; and it occurred to us at last to go forth
together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. No
sooner said than done. Bare-headed as we were, we ran
out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog.</p>

<p>The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though
out of view, on the other side of the next cove; and what
greatly encouraged me, it was in an opposite direction from
that whence the blind man had made his appearance, and
whither he had presumably returned. We were not many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay
hold of each other and hearken. But there was no unusual
sound&mdash;nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the
croaking of the crows in the wood.</p>

<p>It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet,
and I shall never forget how much I was cheered to see the
yellow shine in doors and windows; but that, as it proved,
was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter.
For&mdash;you would have thought men would have been
ashamed of themselves&mdash;no soul would consent to return
with us to the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow.&rdquo; The more we told of
our troubles, the more&mdash;man, woman, and child&mdash;they
clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of Captain
Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known
to some there, and carried a great weight of terror. Some
of the men who had been to field-work on the far side of the
&ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo; remembered, besides, to have seen
several strangers on the road, and, taking them to be
smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen
a little lugger in what we called Kitt&rsquo;s Hole. For that
matter, any one who was a comrade of the captain&rsquo;s was
enough to frighten them to death. And the short and the
long of the matter was, that while we could get several who
were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey&rsquo;s, which lay in
another direction, not one would help us to defend the inn.</p>

<p>They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is,
on the other hand, a great emboldener; and so when each
had said his say, my mother made them a speech. She
would not, she declared, lose money that belonged to her
fatherless boy; &ldquo;if none of the rest of you dare,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and
small thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men.
We&rsquo;ll have that chest open, if we die for it. And I&rsquo;ll thank
you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to bring back our lawful
money in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, I said I would go with my mother; and of
course they all cried out at our foolhardiness; but even then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
not a man would go along with us. All they would do was
to give me a loaded pistol, lest we were attacked; and to
promise to have horses ready saddled, in case we were
pursued on our return; while one lad was to ride forward to
the doctor&rsquo;s in search of armed assistance.</p>

<p>My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in
the cold night upon this dangerous venture. A full moon
was beginning to rise, and peered redly through the upper
edges of the fog, and this increased our haste, for it was plain,
before we came forth again, that all would be as bright as
day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.
We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did
we see or hear anything to increase our terrors, till, to our
huge relief, the door of the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo; had closed
behind us.</p>

<p>I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for
a moment in the dark, alone in the house with the dead
captain&rsquo;s body. Then my mother got a candle in the bar,
and, holding each other&rsquo;s hands, we advanced into the
parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his
eyes open, and one arm stretched out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Draw down the blind, Jim,&rdquo; whispered my mother;
&ldquo;they might come and watch outside. And now,&rdquo; said
she, when I had done so, &ldquo;we have to get the key off <i>that</i>;
and who&rsquo;s to touch it, I should like to know!&rdquo; and she gave
a kind of sob as she said the words.</p>

<p>I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to
his hand there was a little round of paper, blackened on the
one side. I could not doubt that this was the <i>black spot</i>;
and taking it up, I found written on the other side, in a very
good, clear hand, this short message: &ldquo;You have till ten
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had till ten, mother,&rdquo; said I; and just as I said it
our old clock began striking. This sudden noise startled
us shockingly; but the news was good, for it was only six.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jim,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
coins, a thimble, and some thread and big needles, a piece
of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the
crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a tinder-box, were
all that they contained, and I began to despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s round his neck,&rdquo; suggested my mother.</p>

<p>Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt
at the neck, and there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry
string, which I cut with his own gully, we found the key.
At this triumph we were filled with hope, and hurried upstairs,
without delay, to the little room where he had slept
so long, and where his box had stood since the day of his
arrival.</p>

<p>It was like any other seaman&rsquo;s chest on the outside, the
initial &ldquo;B.&rdquo; burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the
corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long, rough
usage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the key,&rdquo; said my mother; and though the
lock was very stiff, she had turned it and thrown back the
lid in a twinkling.</p>

<p>A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior,
but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very
good clothes, carefully brushed and folded. They had
never been worn, my mother said. Under that, the miscellany
began&mdash;a quadrant, a tin cannikin, several sticks
of tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of
bar silver, an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of
little value and mostly of foreign make, a pair of compasses
mounted with brass, and five or six curious West Indian
shells. It has often set me thinking since that he should
have carried about these shells with him in his wandering,
guilty, and hunted life.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but
the silver and the trinkets, and neither of these were in our
way. Underneath there was an old boat-cloak, whitened
with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My mother pulled
it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last
things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
like papers, and a canvas bag, that gave forth, at a touch,
the jingle of gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show these rogues that I&rsquo;m an honest woman,&rdquo;
said my mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my dues, and not a farthing
over. Hold Mrs. Crossley&rsquo;s bag.&rdquo; And she began to count
over the amount of the captain&rsquo;s score from the sailor&rsquo;s bag
into the one that I was holding.</p>

<p>It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all
countries and sizes&mdash;doubloons, and louis-d&rsquo;ors, and guineas,
and pieces of eight, and I know not what besides, all shaken
together at random. The guineas, too, were about the
scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother knew
how to make her count.</p>

<p>When we were about half-way through I suddenly put
my hand upon her arm; for I had heard in the silent, frosty
air, a sound that brought my heart into my mouth&mdash;the
tap-tapping of the blind man&rsquo;s stick upon the frozen road.
It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.
Then it struck sharp on the inn-door, and then we could
hear the handle being turned, and the bolt rattling as the
wretched being tried to enter; and then there was a long
time of silence both within and without. At last the tapping
recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and gratitude,
died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;take the whole and let&rsquo;s be going;&rdquo;
for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious,
and would bring the whole hornets&rsquo; nest about our ears;
though how thankful I was that I had bolted it, none could
tell who had never met that terrible blind man.</p>

<p>But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent
to take a fraction more than was due to her, and was
obstinately unwilling to be content with less. It was not
yet seven, she said, by a long way; she knew her rights and
she would have them; and she was still arguing with me,
when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the
hill. That was enough, and more than enough, for both
of us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take what I have,&rdquo; she said, jumping to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take this to square the count,&rdquo; said I, picking
up the oilskin packet.</p>

<p>Next moment we were both groping down-stairs, leaving
the candle by the empty chest; and the next we had opened
the door and were in full retreat. We had not started a
moment too soon. The fog was rapidly dispersing; already
the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either
side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and
round the tavern-door that a thin veil still hung unbroken
to conceal the first steps of our escape. Far less than half-way
to the hamlet, very little beyond the bottom of the hill,
we must come forth into the moonlight. Nor was this all,
for the sound of several footsteps running came already to
our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a light
tossing to and fro, and still rapidly advancing, showed that
one of the new-comers carried a lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my mother suddenly, &ldquo;take the money
and run on. I am going to faint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought.
How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours; how I
blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed, for
her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were
just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her,
tottering as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure
enough, she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder. I do not
know how I found the strength to do it at all, and I am
afraid it was roughly done; but I managed to drag her
down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther
I could not move her, for the bridge was too low to let me do
more than crawl below it. So there we had to stay&mdash;my
mother almost entirely exposed, and both of us within earshot
of the inn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>THE LAST OF THE BLIND MAN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">My</span> curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear; for I
could not remain where I was, but crept back to the bank
again, whence, sheltering my head behind a bush of broom,
I might command the road before our door. I was scarcely
in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or eight
of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along
the road, and the man with the lantern some paces in front.
Three men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out,
even through the mist, that the middle man of this trio was
the blind beggar. The next moment his voice showed me
that I was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the door!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; answered two or three; and a rush was
made upon the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow,&rdquo; the lantern-bearer
following; and then I could see them pause, and hear
speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to
find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind
man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder
and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In, in, in!&rdquo; he shouted, and cursed them for their
delay.</p>

<p>Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on
the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause,
then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the
house&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the blind man swore at them again for their delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest
of you aloft and get the chest,&rdquo; he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that
the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards,
fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the
captain&rsquo;s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of
broken glass; and a man leaned out into the moonlight,
head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the
road below him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pew,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been before us. Someone&rsquo;s
turned the chest out alow and aloft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it there?&rdquo; roared Pew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The money&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blind man cursed the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flint&rsquo;s fist, I mean,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see it here nohow,&rdquo; returned the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you below there, is it on Bill?&rdquo; cried the blind
man again.</p>

<p>At that, another fellow, probably him who had remained
below to search the captain&rsquo;s body, came to the door of the
inn. &ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s been overhauled a&rsquo;ready,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;nothin&rsquo;
left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these people of the inn&mdash;it&rsquo;s that boy. I wish
I had put his eyes out!&rdquo; cried the blind man, Pew. &ldquo;They
were here no time ago&mdash;they had the door bolted when I
tried it. Scatter, lads, and find &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, they left their glim here,&rdquo; said the fellow
from the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scatter and find &rsquo;em! Rout the house out!&rdquo; reiterated
Pew, striking with his stick upon the road.</p>

<p>Then there followed a great to-do through all our old
inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over,
doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed, and the men
came out again, one after another, on the road, and declared
that we were nowhere to be found. And just then the same
whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the
dead captain&rsquo;s money was once more clearly audible through
the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to
be the blind man&rsquo;s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
crew to the assault; but I now found that it was a signal
from the hillside towards the hamlet, and, from its effect
upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching
danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Dirk again,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Twice! We&rsquo;ll have
to budge, mates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Budge, you skulk!&rdquo; cried Pew. &ldquo;Dirk was a fool
and a coward from the first&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t mind him.
They must be close by; they can&rsquo;t be far; you have your
hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs. Oh, shiver
my soul,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if I had eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of
the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber,
but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their
own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on
the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and
you hang a leg! You&rsquo;d be as rich as kings if you could find
it, and you know it&rsquo;s here, and you stand there malingering.
There wasn&rsquo;t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it&mdash;a
blind man! And I&rsquo;m to lose my chance for you! I&rsquo;m to
be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might
be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a
biscuit you would catch them still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it, Pew, we&rsquo;ve got the doubloons!&rdquo; grumbled
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They might have hid the blessed thing,&rdquo; said another.
&ldquo;Take the Georges, Pew, and don&rsquo;t stand here squalling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Squalling was the word for it, Pew&rsquo;s anger rose so high
at these objections; till at last, his passion completely
taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in
his blindness, and his stick sounded heavily on more than
one.</p>

<p>These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant,
threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch
the stick and wrest it from his grasp.</p>

<p>This quarrel was the saving of us; for while it was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the
side of the hamlet&mdash;the tramp of horses galloping. Almost
at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from
the hedge-side. And that was plainly the last signal of
danger; for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating
in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one
slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not
a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted,
whether in sheer panic, or out of revenge for his ill words
and blows, I know not; but there he remained behind,
tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and
calling for his comrades. Finally he took the wrong turn,
and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet,
crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,&rdquo; and other names, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t leave old Pew, mates&mdash;not old Pew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four
or five riders came in sight in the moonlight, and swept at
full gallop down the slope.</p>

<p>At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran
straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on
his feet again in a second, and made another dash, now
utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming
horses.</p>

<p>The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went
Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four
hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell
on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face, and moved
no more.</p>

<p>I leapt to my feet and hailed the riders. They were
pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon
saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a
lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey&rsquo;s; the
rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way,
and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once.
Some news of the lugger in Kitt&rsquo;s Hole had found its way to
Supervisor Dance, and set him forth that night in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed
our preservation from death.</p>

<p>Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when
we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and
salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none
the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore
the balance of the money. In the meantime, the
supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt&rsquo;s Hole; but
his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading,
and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual
fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that
when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under
way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied,
telling him to keep out of the moonlight, or he would get
some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled
close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point
and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, &ldquo;like
a fish out of water,&rdquo; and all he could do was to despatch a
man to B&mdash;&mdash; to warn the cutter. &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is just about as good as nothing. They&rsquo;ve got off clean,
and there&rsquo;s an end. Only,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I trod on
Master Pew&rsquo;s corns;&rdquo; for by this time he had heard my story.</p>

<p>I went back with him to the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow,&rdquo; and
you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the
very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their
furious hunt after my mother and myself, and though nothing
had been actually taken away except the captain&rsquo;s
money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once
that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the
scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins,
what in fortune were they after; more money, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; not money, I think,&rdquo; replied I. &ldquo;In fact,
sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast-pocket; and, to
tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, boy; quite right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,
if you like.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought, perhaps, Dr. Livesey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly right,&rdquo; he interrupted, very cheerily, &ldquo;perfectly
right&mdash;a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now
I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself
and report to him or squire. Master Pew&rsquo;s dead, when all&rsquo;s
done; not that I regret it, but he&rsquo;s dead, you see, and people
will make it out against an officer of His Majesty&rsquo;s revenue,
if make it out they can. Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Hawkins: if
you like, I&rsquo;ll take you along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back
to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had
told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dogger,&rdquo; said Mr. Dance, &ldquo;you have a good horse;
take up this lad behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger&rsquo;s belt,
the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a
bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey&rsquo;s house.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>THE CAPTAIN&rsquo;S PAPERS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">We</span> rode hard all the way, till we drew up before Dr.
Livesey&rsquo;s door. The house was all dark to the front.</p>

<p>Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger
gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened
almost at once by the maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Livesey in?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>No, she said; he had come home in the afternoon, but
had gone up to the Hall to dine and pass the evening with
the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there we go, boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Dance.</p>

<p>This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount,
but ran with Dogger&rsquo;s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates,
and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white
line of the Hall buildings looked on either hand on great old
gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and, taking me along
with him, was admitted at a word into the house.</p>

<p>The servant led us down a matted passage, and showed
us at the end into a great library, all lined with book-cases
and busts upon the top of them, where the squire and Dr.
Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire.</p>

<p>I had never seen the squire so near at hand. He was
a tall man, over six feet high, and broad in proportion, and
he had a bluff, rough-and-ready face, all roughened and
reddened and lined in his long travels. His eyebrows were
very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of
some temper&mdash;not bad, you would say, but quick and high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr. Dance,&rdquo; says he, very stately and condescending.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Dance,&rdquo; says the doctor, with a nod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
&ldquo;And good-evening to you, friend Jim. What good wind
brings you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The supervisor stood up straight and stiff, and told his
story like a lesson; and you should have seen how the two
gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and
forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest. When they
heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr. Livesey
fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried, &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;
and broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it
was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the
squire&rsquo;s name) had got up from his seat, and was striding
about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better,
had taken off his powdered wig, and sat there, looking
very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black
poll.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Dance finished the story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dance,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;you are a very noble
fellow. And as for riding down that black, atrocious
miscreant, I regard it as an act of virtue, sir, like stamping
on a cockroach. This lad Hawkins is a trump, I perceive.&mdash;Hawkins,
will you ring that bell? Mr. Dance must have
some ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, Jim,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you have the thing
that they were after, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is, sir,&rdquo; said I, and gave him the oilskin packet.</p>

<p>The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching
to open it; but, instead of doing that, he put it quietly in
the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Squire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when Dance has had his ale he must,
of course, be off on His Majesty&rsquo;s service; but I mean to
keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house, and, with your
permission, I propose we should have up the cold pie, and
let him sup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will, Livesey,&rdquo; said the squire; &ldquo;Hawkins
has earned better than cold pie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So a big pigeon-pie was brought in and put on a side-table,
and I made a hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
hawk, while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at
last dismissed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, squire,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Livesey,&rdquo; said the squire, in the same breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One at a time, one at a time,&rdquo; laughed Dr. Livesey.&mdash;&ldquo;You
have heard of this Flint, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard of him!&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;Heard of him,
you say! He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed.
Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so
prodigiously afraid of him, that I tell you, sir, I was sometimes
proud he was an Englishman. I&rsquo;ve seen his top-sails
with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a
rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back&mdash;put back, sir,
into Port-of-Spain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve heard of him myself, in England,&rdquo; said the
doctor. &ldquo;But the point is, had he money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;Have you heard the
story? What were these villains after but money? What
do they care for but money? For what would they risk
their rascal carcases but money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we shall soon know,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;But
you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that
I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this:
Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where
Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to
much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amount, sir!&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;It will amount
to this: if we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship
in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and
I&rsquo;ll have that treasure if I search a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Now, then, if Jim is
agreeable, we&rsquo;ll open the packet;&rdquo; and he laid it before him
on the table.</p>

<p>The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get
out his instrument-case, and cut the stitches with his medical
scissors. It contained two things&mdash;a book and a sealed
paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all we&rsquo;ll try the book,&rdquo; observed the doctor.</p>

<p>The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder
as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me
to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating,
to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there
were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen
in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was
the same as the tattoo-mark, &ldquo;Billy Bones his fancy;&rdquo;
then there was &ldquo;Mr. W. Bones, mate.&rdquo; &ldquo;No more rum.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Off Palm Key he got itt;&rdquo; and some other snatches,
mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help
wondering who it was that had &ldquo;got itt,&rdquo; and what &ldquo;itt&rdquo;
was that he got. A knife in his back as like as not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much instruction there,&rdquo; said Dr. Livesey, as he
passed on.</p>

<p>The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious
series of entries. There was a date at one end of the line
and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books;
but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying
number of crosses between the two. On the 12th of June,
1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly
become due to some one, and there was nothing but six
crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure,
the name of a place would be added, as &ldquo;Offe Caraccas;&rdquo;
or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as &ldquo;62&deg; 17' 20",
19&deg; 2' 40".&rdquo;</p>

<p>The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount
of the separate entries growing larger as time went on, and
at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six
wrong additions, and these words appended, &ldquo;Bones his
pile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make head or tail of this,&rdquo; said Dr. Livesey.
&ldquo;The thing is as clear as noonday,&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;This
is the black-hearted hound&rsquo;s account-book. These crosses
stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or
plundered. The sums are the scoundrel&rsquo;s share, and where
he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something clearer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
&lsquo;Offe Caraccas,&rsquo; now; you see, here was some unhappy
vessel boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that
manned her&mdash;coral long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;See what it is to be a
traveller. Right! And the amounts increase, you see,
as he rose in rank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was little else in the volume but a few bearings
of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end, and a
table for reducing French, English, and Spanish moneys to
a common value.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thrifty man!&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t the
one to be cheated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;for the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The paper had been sealed in several places with a
thimble by way of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I
had found in the captain&rsquo;s pocket. The doctor opened the
seals with great care, and there fell out the map of an island,
with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of hills, and
bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed
to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was
about nine miles long and five across, shaped, you might
say, like a fat dragon standing up, and had two fine land-locked
harbours, and a hill in the centre part marked &ldquo;The
Spy-glass.&rdquo; There were several additions of a later date;
but, above all, three crosses of red ink&mdash;two on the north
part of the island, one in the south-west, and, beside this
last, in the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very
different from the captain&rsquo;s tottery characters, these words:
&ldquo;Bulk of treasure here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over on the back the same hand had written this further
information:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to the <span class="scs">N.</span> of <span class="scs">N.N.E.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Skeleton Island <span class="scs">E.S.E.</span> and by <span class="scs">E.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find it by the trend
of the east hummock, ten fathoms south of the black crag with the
face on it.</p>

cape, bearing <span class="scs">E.</span> and a quarter <span class="scs">N.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 2em;">J. F.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>That was all; but brief as it was, and, to me, incomprehensible,
it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Livesey,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;you will give up this
wretched practice at once. To-morrow I start for Bristol.
In three weeks&rsquo; time&mdash;three weeks!&mdash;two weeks&mdash;ten days&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
have the best ship, sir, and the choicest crew in
England. Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy. You&rsquo;ll
make a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins. You, Livesey, are
ship&rsquo;s doctor; I am admiral. We&rsquo;ll take Redruth, Joyce,
and Hunter. We&rsquo;ll have favourable winds, a quick passage,
and not the least difficulty in finding the spot, and money
to eat&mdash;to roll in&mdash;to play duck-and-drake with ever after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trelawney,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you; and,
I&rsquo;ll go bail for it, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking.
There&rsquo;s only one man I&rsquo;m afraid of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;Name the dog,
sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; replied the doctor; &ldquo;for you cannot hold your
tongue. We are not the only men who know of this paper.
These fellows who attacked the inn to-night&mdash;bold, desperate
blades, for sure&mdash;and the rest who stayed aboard that
lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all,
through thick and thin, bound that they&rsquo;ll get that money.
We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and
I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you&rsquo;ll take Joyce
and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and, from first to last,
not one of us must breathe a word of what we&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Livesey,&rdquo; returned the squire, &ldquo;you are always in the
right of it. I&rsquo;ll be as silent as the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>I GO TO BRISTOL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">It</span> was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready
for the sea, and none of our first plans&mdash;not even Dr.
Livesey&rsquo;s, of keeping me beside him&mdash;could be carried out
as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a
physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard
at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the Hall under the
charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner,
but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations
of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour
together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered.
Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room,
I approached that island in my fancy, from every possible
direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a
thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and
from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects.
Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with
whom we fought; sometimes full of dangerous animals that
hunted us; but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me
so strange and tragic as our actual adventures.</p>

<p>So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a
letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, &ldquo;To
be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth, or
young Hawkins.&rdquo; Obeying this order, we found, or rather,
I found&mdash;for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading
anything but print&mdash;the following important news:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1.5em;">&ldquo;<i>Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March</i> 1, 17&mdash;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Livesey</span>,&mdash;As I do not know whether you are at the Hall
or still in London, I send this in double to both places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at anchor, ready for sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
You never imagined a sweeter schooner&mdash;a child might sail her&mdash;two
hundred tons; name, <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself
throughout the most surprising trump. The admirable fellow
literally slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did every one in
Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for&mdash;treasure,
I mean.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Redruth,&rdquo; said I, interrupting the letter, &ldquo;Dr. Livesey
will not like that. The squire has been talking, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;s a better right?&rdquo; growled the gamekeeper.
&ldquo;A pretty rum go if squire ain&rsquo;t to talk for Dr. Livesey, I
should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that I gave up all attempt at commentary, and read
straight on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Blandly himself found the <i>Hispaniola</i>, and by the most admirable
management got her for the merest trifle. There is a class of
men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly. They go
the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything
for money, that the <i>Hispaniola</i> belonged to him, and that he sold it
me absurdly high&mdash;the most transparent calumnies. None of them
dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far there was not a hitch. The workpeople, to be sure&mdash;riggers
and what not&mdash;were most annoyingly slow; but time cured
that. It was the crew that troubled me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wished a round score of men&mdash;in case of natives, buccaneers,
or the odious French&mdash;and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find
so much as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke of fortune
brought me the very man that I required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was standing on the dock, when, by the merest accident, I fell
in talk with him. I found he was an old sailor, kept a public-house,
knew all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his health ashore, and
wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again. He had hobbled
down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was monstrously touched&mdash;so would you have been&mdash;and,
out of pure pity, I engaged him on the spot to be ship&rsquo;s cook. Long
John Silver, he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as
a recommendation, since he lost it in his country&rsquo;s service, under
the immortal Hawke. He has no pension, Livesey. Imagine the
abominable age we live in!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew
I had discovered. Between Silver and myself we got together in
a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable&mdash;not
pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of the most indomitable
spirit. I declare we could fight a frigate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had
already engaged. He showed me in a moment that they were just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of
importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in the most magnificent health and spirits, eating like a
bull, sleeping like a tree, yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my
old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan. Seaward ho! Hang
the treasure! It&rsquo;s the glory of the sea that has turned my head. So
now, Livesey, come post; do not lose an hour if you respect me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother, with Redruth
for a guard; and then both come full speed to Bristol.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">John Trelawney.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;I did not tell you that Blandly, who, by the way,
is to send a consort after us if we don&rsquo;t turn up by the end of August,
had found an admirable fellow for sailing master&mdash;a stiff man, which
I regret, but, in all other respects, a treasure. Long John Silver
unearthed a very competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.
I have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things shall go man-o&rsquo;-war
fashion on board the good ship <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance; I know
of my own knowledge that he has a banker&rsquo;s account, which has
never been overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the inn; and
as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old bachelors like you and I
may be excused for guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the
health, that sends him back to roving.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1.4em;">J. T.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>P.P.S.</i>&mdash;Hawkins may stay one night with his mother.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">&ldquo;J. T.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put
me. I was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised
a man, it was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing
but grumble and lament. Any of the under-gamekeepers
would gladly have changed places with him; but such was
not the squire&rsquo;s pleasure, and the squire&rsquo;s pleasure was like
law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have
dared so much as even to grumble.</p>

<p>The next morning he and I set out on foot for the
&ldquo;Admiral Benbow,&rdquo; and there I found my mother in good
health and spirits. The captain, who had so long been a
cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked
cease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired,
and the public rooms and the sign repainted, and
had added some furniture&mdash;above all, a beautiful arm-chair
for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
apprentice also, so that she should not want help while I
was gone.</p>

<p>It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first
time, my situation. I had thought, up to that moment,
of the adventures before me, not at all of the home that I
was leaving; and now, at sight of this clumsy stranger,
who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I had
my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog&rsquo;s
life; for as he was new to the work I had a hundred opportunities
of setting him right and putting him down, and I
was not slow to profit by them.</p>

<p>The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth
and I were afoot again, and on the road. I said good-bye
to mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born,
and the dear old &ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo;&mdash;since he was repainted,
no longer quite so dear. One of my last thoughts
was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach
with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass
telescope. Next moment we had turned the corner, and
my home was out of sight.</p>

<p>The mail picked us up about dusk at the &ldquo;Royal
George&rdquo; on the heath. I was wedged in between Redruth
and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the swift
motion and the cold night-air, I must have dozed a great
deal from the very first, and then slept like a log up hill
and down dale through stage after stage; for when I was
awakened, at last, it was by a punch in the ribs, and I
opened my eyes, to find that we were standing still before
a large building in a city street, and that the day had already
broken a long time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bristol,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Get down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far
down the docks, to superintend the work upon the schooner.
Thither we had now to walk, and our way, to my great
delight, lay along the quays and beside the great multitude
of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
were singing at their work; in another, there were men
aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed
no thicker than a spider&rsquo;s. Though I had lived by the shore
all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till
then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I
saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far
over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with
rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry
pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I
had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have
been more delighted.</p>

<p>And I was going to sea myself; to sea in a schooner,
with a piping boatswain, and pig-tailed singing seamen;
to sea, bound for an unknown island, and to seek for buried
treasures!</p>

<p>While I was still in this delightful dream, we came
suddenly in front of a large inn, and met Squire Trelawney,
all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming
out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation
of a sailor&rsquo;s walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and the doctor came last
night from London. Bravo! the ship&rsquo;s company complete!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;when do we sail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;We sail to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>AT THE SIGN OF THE &ldquo;SPY-GLASS&rdquo;</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">When</span> I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note
addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the &ldquo;Spy-glass,&rdquo;
and told me I should easily find the place by following the
line of the docks, and keeping a bright look-out for a little
tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. I set off, overjoyed
at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and
seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people
and carts and bales, for the dock was now at its busiest,
until I found the tavern in question.</p>

<p>It was a bright enough little place of entertainment.
The sign was newly painted; the windows had neat red
curtains; the floor was cleanly sanded. There was a
street on either side, and an open door on both, which made
the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds
of tobacco-smoke.</p>

<p>The customers were mostly seafaring men; and they
talked so loudly that I hung at the door, almost afraid to
enter.</p>

<p>As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and,
at a glance, I was sure he must be Long John. His left
leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder
he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful
dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very
tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham&mdash;plain and pale,
but intelligent and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most
cheerful spirits, whistling as he moved about among the
tables, with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the
more favoured of his guests.</p>

<p>Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of Long John in Squire Trelawney&rsquo;s letter, I had taken a
fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged
sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old
&ldquo;Benbow.&rdquo; But one look at the man before me was
enough. I had seen the captain, and Black Dog, and the
blind man Pew, and I thought I knew what a buccaneer
was like&mdash;a very different creature, according to me, from
this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.</p>

<p>I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold,
and walked right up to the man where he stood, propped
on his crutch, talking to a customer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Silver, sir?&rdquo; I asked, holding out the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lad,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;such is my name, to be
sure. And who may you be?&rdquo; And then, as he saw the
squire&rsquo;s letter, he seemed to me to give something almost
like a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, quite loud, and offering his hand, &ldquo;I
see. You are our new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he took my hand in his large firm grasp.</p>

<p>Just then one of the customers at the far side rose
suddenly and made for the door. It was close by him,
and he was out in the street in a moment. But his hurry
had attracted my notice, and I recognised him at a glance.
It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had
come first to the &ldquo;Admiral Benbow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;stop him! it&rsquo;s Black Dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care two coppers who he is,&rdquo; cried Silver.
&ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t paid his score.&mdash;Harry, run and catch
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up,
and started in pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,&rdquo;
cried Silver; and then, relinquishing my hand&mdash;&ldquo;Who
did you say he was?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Black what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dog, sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Has Mr. Trelawney not told
you of the buccaneers? He was one of them.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;In my house!&mdash;Ben, run and
help Harry. One of those swabs, was he? Was that you
drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man whom he called Morgan&mdash;an old, grey-haired,
mahogany-faced sailor&mdash;came forward pretty sheepishly,
rolling his quid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Morgan,&rdquo; said Long John, very sternly; &ldquo;you
never clapped your eyes on that Black&mdash;Black Dog before,
did you, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I, sir,&rdquo; said Morgan, with a salute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know his name, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the powers, Tom Morgan, it&rsquo;s as good for you!&rdquo;
exclaimed the landlord. &ldquo;If you had been mixed up with
the like of that, you would never have put another foot in
my house, you may lay to that. And what was he saying
to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know, sir,&rdquo; answered Morgan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a
blessed dead-eye?&rdquo; cried Long John. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rightly
know, don&rsquo;t you! Perhaps you don&rsquo;t happen to rightly
know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come now,
what was he jawing&mdash;v&rsquo;yages, cap&rsquo;ns, ships? Pipe up!
What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was a-talkin&rsquo; of keel-hauling,&rdquo; answered
Morgan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keel-hauling, was you? and a mighty suitable thing,
too, and you may lay to that. Get back to your place
for a lubber, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver
added to me in a confidential whisper, that was very flattering,
as I thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on&rsquo;y stupid.
And now,&rdquo; he ran on again, aloud, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;Black Dog?
No, I don&rsquo;t know the name, not I. Yet I kind of think
I&rsquo;ve&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ve seen the swab. He used to come here with
a blind beggar, he used.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That he did, you may be sure,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I knew
that blind man, too. His name was Pew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; cried Silver, now quite excited. &ldquo;Pew!
That were his name for certain. Ah, he looked a shark,
he did! If we run down this Black Dog, now, there&rsquo;ll be
news for Cap&rsquo;n Trelawney! Ben&rsquo;s a good runner; few
seamen run better than Ben. He should run him down,
hand over hand, by the powers! He talked o&rsquo; keel-hauling,
did he? <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> keel-haul him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was
stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch, slapping
tables with his hand, and giving such a show of excitement
as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow
Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened
on finding Black Dog at the &ldquo;Spy-glass,&rdquo; and
I watched the cook narrowly. But he was too deep, and
too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time the two
men had come back out of breath, and confessed that they
had lost the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves,
I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John
Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, now, Hawkins,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a blessed
hard thing on a man like me, now, ain&rsquo;t it? There&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n
Trelawney&mdash;what&rsquo;s he to think? Here I have this confounded
son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house,
drinking of my own rum! Here you comes and tells me
of it plain; and here I let him give us all the slip before
my blessed dead-lights! Now, Hawkins, you do me justice
with the cap&rsquo;n. You&rsquo;re a lad, you are, but you&rsquo;re as smart
as paint. I see that when you first came in. Now, here
it is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on?
When I was an A B master mariner I&rsquo;d have come up alongside
of him, hand over hand, and broached him to in a
brace of old shakes, I would; but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw
dropped as though he had remembered something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The score!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Three goes o&rsquo; rum!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Why, shiver my timbers, if I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten my
score!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears
ran down his cheeks. I could not help joining; and we
laughed together, peal after peal, until the tavern
rang again.</p>

<p><span class="correction" title="a single quote in text">&ldquo;Why,</span> what a precious old sea-calf I am!&rdquo; he said
at last, wiping his cheeks. &ldquo;You and me should get on
well, Hawkins, for I&rsquo;ll take my davy I should be rated
ship&rsquo;s boy. But come now, stand by to go about. This
won&rsquo;t do. Dooty is dooty, messmates. I&rsquo;ll put on my
old cocked hat, and step along of you to Cap&rsquo;n Trelawney,
and report this here affair. For, mind you, it&rsquo;s serious,
young Hawkins; and neither you nor me&rsquo;s come out of it
with what I should make so bold as to call credit. Nor
you neither, says you; not smart&mdash;none of the pair of us
smart. But, dash my buttons! that was a good &rsquo;un about
my score.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that
though I did not see the joke as he did, I was again obliged
to join him in his mirth.</p>

<p>On our little walk along the quays, he made himself
the most interesting companion, telling me about the
different ships that we passed by, their rig, tonnage, and
nationality, explaining the work that was going forward&mdash;how
one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and
a third making ready for sea; and every now and then
telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen, or repeating
a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly.
I began to see that here was one of the best of possible
shipmates.</p>

<p>When we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey
were seated together, finishing a quart of ale with a toast
in it, before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit
of inspection.</p>

<p>Long John told the story from first to last, with a great
deal of spirit and the most perfect truth. &ldquo;That was how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
it were, now, weren&rsquo;t it, Hawkins?&rdquo; he would say, now
and again, and I could always bear him entirely out.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got
away; but we all agreed there was nothing to be done,
and after he had been complimented, Long John took up
his crutch and departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands aboard by four this afternoon,&rdquo; shouted
the squire after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; cried the cook, in the passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, squire,&rdquo; said Dr. Livesey, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t put much
faith in your discoveries as a general thing; but I will say
this, John Silver suits me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a perfect trump,&rdquo; declared the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; added the doctor, &ldquo;Jim may come on
board with us, may he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure he may,&rdquo; says squire.&mdash;&ldquo;Take your hat,
Hawkins, and we&rsquo;ll see the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>POWDER AND ARMS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Hispaniola</i> lay some way out, and we went under the
figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and
their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and
sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside,
and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by
the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor, with earrings in
his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick
and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the
same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain.</p>

<p>This last was a sharp-looking man, who seemed angry
with everything on board, and was soon to tell us why, for
we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed
us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am always at the captain&rsquo;s orders. Show him in,&rdquo;
said the squire.</p>

<p>The captain, who was close behind his messenger,
entered at once, and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All
well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;better speak plain, I
believe, even at the risk of offence. I don&rsquo;t like this cruise;
I don&rsquo;t like the men; and I don&rsquo;t like my officer. That&rsquo;s
short and sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, sir, you don&rsquo;t like the ship?&rdquo; inquired the
squire, very angry, as I could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak as to that, sir, not having seen her
tried,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;She seems a clever craft; more
I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer,
either?&rdquo; says the squire.</p>

<p>But here Dr. Livesey cut in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay a bit,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;stay a bit. No use of such
questions as that but to produce ill-feeling. The captain
has said too much or he has said too little, and I&rsquo;m bound
to say that I require an explanation of his words. You
don&rsquo;t, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to
sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,&rdquo;
said the captain. &ldquo;So far so good. But now I find that
every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don&rsquo;t
call that fair, now&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dr. Livesey, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I learn we are going after
treasure&mdash;hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now,
treasure is ticklish work; I don&rsquo;t like treasure-voyages on
any account; and I don&rsquo;t like them, above all, when they
are secret, and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney)
the secret has been told to the parrot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silver&rsquo;s parrot?&rdquo; asked the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way of speaking,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Blabbed,
I mean. It&rsquo;s my belief neither of you gentlemen know
what you are about; but I&rsquo;ll tell you my way of it&mdash;life
or death, and a close run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all clear, and, I daresay, true enough,&rdquo; replied
Dr. Livesey. &ldquo;We take the risk; but we are not so
ignorant as you believe us.&mdash;Next, you say you don&rsquo;t like
the crew. Are they not good seamen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like them, sir,&rdquo; returned Captain Smollett.
&ldquo;And I think I should have had the choosing of my own
hands, if you go to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you should,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;My
friend should perhaps have taken you along with him; but
the slight, if there be one, was unintentional.&mdash;And you
don&rsquo;t like Mr. Arrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, sir. I believe he&rsquo;s a good seaman; but he&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
too free with the crew to be a good officer. A mate should
keep himself to himself&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t drink with the men
before the mast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean he drinks?&rdquo; cried the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the captain; &ldquo;only that he&rsquo;s too
familiar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?&rdquo;
asked the doctor. &ldquo;Tell us what you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this
cruise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like iron,&rdquo; answered the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Then, as you&rsquo;ve
heard me very patiently, saying things that I could not
prove, hear me a few words more. They are putting the
powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have
a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?&mdash;first
point. Then you are bringing four of your own
people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be
berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here
beside the cabin?&mdash;second point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any more?&rdquo; asked Mr. Trelawney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been too
much blabbing already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far too much,&rdquo; agreed the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve heard myself,&rdquo; continued
Captain Smollett: &ldquo;that you have a map of an island;
that there&rsquo;s crosses on the map to show where treasure
is; and that the island lies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And then he named the
latitude and longitude exactly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never told that,&rdquo; cried the squire, &ldquo;to a soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hands know it, sir,&rdquo; returned the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,&rdquo; cried
the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t much matter who it was,&rdquo; replied the
doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain
paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney&rsquo;s protestations.
Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
this case I believe he was really right, and that nobody had
told the situation of the island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be
kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I
would ask you to let me resign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You wish us to keep this
matter dark, and to make a garrison of the stern part of
the ship, manned with my friend&rsquo;s own people, and provided
with all the arms and powder on board. In other
words, you fear a mutiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Captain Smollett, &ldquo;with no intention to
take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth.
No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if
he had ground enough to say that. As for Mr. Arrow, I
believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the
same; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible
for the ship&rsquo;s safety and the life of every man-Jack aboard
of her. I see things going, as I think, not quite right. And
I ask you to take certain precautions, or let me resign my
berth. And that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Smollett,&rdquo; began the doctor, with a smile,
&ldquo;did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the
mouse? You&rsquo;ll excuse me, I daresay, but you remind me
of that fable. When you came in here I&rsquo;ll stake my wig
you meant more than this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;you are smart. When
I came in here I meant to get discharged. I had no thought
that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more I would,&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;Had Livesey
not been here, I should have seen you to the deuce. As it
is, I have heard you. I will do as you desire; but I think
the worse of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you please, sir,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
find I do my duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he took his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trelawney,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;contrary to all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
notions, I believe you have managed to get two honest
men on board with you&mdash;that man and John Silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silver, if you like,&rdquo; cried the squire; &ldquo;but as for that
intolerable humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly,
unsailorly, and downright un-English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the doctor, &ldquo;we shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we came on deck, the men had begun already
to take out the arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their work,
while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending.</p>

<p>The new arrangement was quite to my liking. The
whole schooner had been overhauled; six berths had been
made astern, out of what had been the after-part of the
main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to the
galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side.
It had been originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow,
Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire, were to occupy
these six berths. Now, Redruth and I were to get two of
them, and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck
in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side
till you might almost have called it a round-house. Very
low it was still, of course; but there was room to swing
two hammocks, and even the mate seemed pleased with the
arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful as
to the crew, but that is only guess; for, as you shall hear,
we had not long the benefit of his opinion.</p>

<p>We were all hard at work, changing the powder and
the berths, when the last man or two, and Long John along
with them, came off in a shore-boat.</p>

<p>The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness,
and, as soon as he saw what was doing, &ldquo;So ho,
mates!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a-changing of the powder, Jack,&rdquo; answers one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, by the powers,&rdquo; cried Long John, &ldquo;if we do,
we&rsquo;ll miss the morning tide!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My orders!&rdquo; said the captain shortly. &ldquo;You may
go below, my man. Hands will want supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; answered the cook; and, touching his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
forelock, he disappeared at once in the direction of the
galley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good man, captain,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely, sir,&rdquo; replied Captain Smollett.&mdash;&ldquo;Easy
with that, men&mdash;easy,&rdquo; he ran on, to the fellows who were
shifting the powder; and then suddenly observing me
examining the swivel we carried amidships, a long brass
nine&mdash;&ldquo;Here, you ship&rsquo;s boy,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;out o&rsquo; that!
Off with you to the cook and get some work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then as I was hurrying off, I heard him say, quite
loudly, to the doctor&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no favourites on my ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assure you I was quite of the squire&rsquo;s way of thinking,
and hated the captain deeply.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h5>THE VOYAGE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">All</span> the night we were in a great bustle getting things
stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire&rsquo;s friends,
Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good
voyage and a safe return. We never had a night at the
&ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo; when I had half the work; and I was
dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded
his pipe, and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I
might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left
the deck; all was so new and interesting to me&mdash;the brief
commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling
to their places in the glimmer of the ship&rsquo;s lanterns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,&rdquo; cried one voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old one,&rdquo; cried another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, mates,&rdquo; said Long John, who was standing
by, with his crutch under his arm, and at once broke out
in the air and words I knew so well&mdash;</p>

<p class="f90 bmarg noind center">&ldquo;Fifteen men on the dead man&rsquo;s chest&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">and then the whole crew bore chorus&mdash;</p>

<p class="f90 bmarg noind center">&ldquo;Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">And at the third &ldquo;ho!&rdquo; drove the bars before them with
a will.</p>

<p>Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the
old &ldquo;Admiral Benbow&rdquo; in a second; and I seemed to hear
the voice of the captain piping in the chorus. But soon
the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at
the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie
down to snatch an hour of slumber the <i>Hispaniola</i> had begun
her voyage to the Isle of Treasure.</p>

<p>I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was
fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the
crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly
understood his business. But before we came the length
of Treasure Island two or three things had happened which
require to be known.</p>

<p>Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the
captain had feared. He had no command among the men,
and people did what they pleased with him. But that
was by no means the worst of it; for, after a day or two at
sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,
stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time
after time he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes
he fell and cut himself; sometimes he lay all day long in
his little bunk at one side of the companion; sometimes for
a day or two he would be almost sober, and attend to his
work at least passably.</p>

<p>In the meantime we could never make out where he
got the drink. That was the ship&rsquo;s mystery. Watch him
as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when
we asked him to his face, he would only laugh, if he were
drunk, and if he were sober, deny solemnly that he ever
tasted anything but water.</p>

<p>He was not only useless as an officer, and a bad influence
amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must
soon kill himself outright; so nobody was much surprised,
nor very sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he
disappeared entirely and was seen no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Overboard!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,
that saves the trouble of putting him in irons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary,
of course, to advance one of the men. The boatswain,
Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and, though
he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made
him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy
weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful,
wily, old, experienced seaman, who could be trusted at a
pinch with almost anything.</p>

<p>He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so
the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship&rsquo;s
cook, Barbecue, as the men called him.</p>

<p>Aboard-ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round
his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was
something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against
a bulkhead, and, propped against it, yielding to every
movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like some
one safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in
the heaviest of weather cross the deck. He had a line
or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces&mdash;Long
John&rsquo;s earrings they were called; and he would hand
himself from one place to another, now using the crutch,
now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as
another man could walk. Yet some of the men who had
sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so
reduced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no common man, Barbecue,&rdquo; said the coxswain
to me. &ldquo;He had good schooling in his young days, and
can speak like a book when so minded; and brave&mdash;a lion&rsquo;s
nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple four,
and knock their heads together&mdash;him unarmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the crew respected, and even obeyed him. He had
a way of talking to each, and doing everybody some particular
service. To me he was unweariedly kind; and
always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept as clean
as a new pin; the dishes hanging up burnished, and his
parrot in a cage in one corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come away, Hawkins,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;come and
have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself,
my son. Sit you down and hear the news. Here&rsquo;s
Cap&rsquo;n Flint&mdash;I calls my parrot Cap&rsquo;n Flint, after the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
buccaneer&mdash;here&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Flint predicting success to our
v&rsquo;yage.&mdash;Wasn&rsquo;t you, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, &ldquo;Pieces
of eight! pieces of eight! pieces of eight!&rdquo; till you wondered
that it was not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief
over the cage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that bird,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;is, maybe, two
hundred years old, Hawkins&mdash;they lives for ever mostly;
and if anybody&rsquo;s seen more wickedness, it must be the
devil himself. She&rsquo;s sailed with England, the great Cap&rsquo;n
England, the pirate. She&rsquo;s been at Madagascar, and at
Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello.
She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It&rsquo;s
there she learned &lsquo;Pieces of eight,&rsquo; and little wonder;
three hundred and fifty thousand of &rsquo;em, Hawkins! She
was at the boarding of the Viceroy of the Indies out of Goa,
she was; and to look at her you would think she was a
babby. But you smelt powder&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by to go about,&rdquo; the parrot would scream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s a handsome craft, she is,&rdquo; the cook would
say, and give her sugar from his pocket, and then the bird
would peck at the bars and swear straight on, passing belief
for wickedness. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; John would add, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here&rsquo;s this poor old
innocent bird o&rsquo; mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser,
you may lay to that. She would swear the same, in a
manner of speaking, before chaplain.&rdquo; And John would
touch his forelock with a solemn way he had, that made
me think he was the best of men.</p>

<p>In the meantime the squire and Captain Smollett were
still on pretty distant terms with one another. The squire
made no bones about the matter; he despised the captain.
The captain, on his part, never spoke but when he was
spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a
word wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that
he seemed to have been wrong about the crew, that some of
them were as brisk as he wanted to see, and all had behaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a downright
fancy to her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll lie a point nearer the wind than a
man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir.
But,&rdquo; he would add, &ldquo;all I say is we&rsquo;re not home again, and
I don&rsquo;t like the cruise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire, at this, would turn away and march up and
down the deck, chin in air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trifle more of that man,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;and I
should explode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had some heavy weather, which only proved the
qualities of the <i>Hispaniola</i>. Every man on board seemed
well content, and they must have been hard to please if
they had been otherwise; for it is my belief that there was
never a ship&rsquo;s company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.
Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff
on odd days, as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any
man&rsquo;s birthday, and always a barrel of apples standing
broached in the waist, for any one to help himself that had
a fancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never knew good come of it yet,&rdquo; the captain said
to Dr. Livesey. &ldquo;Spoil foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;le hands, make devils. That&rsquo;s
my belief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But good did come of the apple-barrel, as you shall
hear; for if it had not been for that we should have had no
note of warning, and might all have perished by the hand
of treachery.</p>

<p>This was how it came about.</p>

<p>We had ran up the trades to get the wind of the island
we were after&mdash;I am not allowed to be more plain,&mdash;and
now we were running down for it with a bright look-out day
and night. It was about the last day of our outward voyage,
by the largest computation; some time that night, or, at
latest, before noon of the morrow, we should sight the
Treasure Island. We were heading <span class="scs">s.s.w.</span>, and had a
steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea. The <i>Hispaniola</i>
rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with a
whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
one was in the bravest spirits, because we were now so near
an end of the first part of our adventure.</p>

<p>Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over,
and I was on my way to my berth, it occurred to me that
I should like an apple. I ran on deck. The watch was all
forward looking out for the island. The man at the helm
was watching the luff of the sail, and whistling away gently
to himself; and that was the only sound excepting the
swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of
the ship.</p>

<p>In I got bodily into the apple-barrel, and found there
was scarce an apple left; but, sitting down there in the
dark, what with the sound of the waters and the rocking
movement of the ship, I had either fallen asleep, or was on
the point of doing so, when a heavy man sat down with
rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his
shoulders against it, and I was just about to jump up when
the man began to speak. It was Silver&rsquo;s voice, and, before
I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself
for all the world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in
the extreme of fear and curiosity; for from these dozen
words I understood that the lives of all the honest men
aboard depended upon me alone.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h5>WHAT I HEARD IN THE APPLE-BARREL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;No</span>, not I,&rdquo; said Silver. &ldquo;Flint was cap&rsquo;n; I was
quartermaster, along of my timber leg. The same broadside
I lost my leg old Pew lost his dead-lights. It was a
master surgeon, him that ampytated me&mdash;out of college
and all&mdash;Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was
hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso
Castle. That was Roberts&rsquo; men, that was, and comed of
changing names to their ships&mdash;<i>Royal Fortune</i> and so on.
Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I say.
So it was with the <i>Cassandra</i>, as brought us all safe home
from Malabar, after England took the Viceroy of the Indies;
so it was with the old <i>Walrus</i>, Flint&rsquo;s old ship, as I&rsquo;ve seen
a-muck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried another voice, that of the youngest hand
on board, and evidently full of admiration, &ldquo;he was the
flower of the flock, was Flint!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davis was a man, too, by all accounts,&rdquo; said Silver.
&ldquo;I never sailed along of him; first with England, then
with Flint, that&rsquo;s my story; and now here on my own
account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred
safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That
ain&rsquo;t bad for a man before the mast&mdash;all safe in bank.
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t earning now, it&rsquo;s saving does it, you may lay to that.
Where&rsquo;s all England&rsquo;s men now? I dunno. Where&rsquo;s
Flint&rsquo;s? Why, most on &rsquo;em aboard here, and glad to get
the duff&mdash;been begging before that, some on &rsquo;em. Old
Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame,
spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parlia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>ment.
Where is he now? Well, he&rsquo;s dead now and under
hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers!
the man was starving. He begged, and he stole, and he cut
throats, and starved at that, by the powers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t much use, after all,&rdquo; said the young
seaman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much use for fools, you may lay to it&mdash;that,
nor nothing,&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;But now, you look here:
you&rsquo;re young, you are, but you&rsquo;re as smart as paint. I see
that when I set my eyes on you, and I&rsquo;ll talk to you like a
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable
old rogue addressing another in the very same words
of flattery as he had used to myself. I think, if I had been
able, that I would have killed him through the barrel.
Meantime he ran on, little supposing he was overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives
rough, and they risk swinging, but they eat and drink
like fighting cocks, and when a cruise is done, why, it&rsquo;s
hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in
their pockets. Now, the most goes for rum and a good
fling, and to sea again in their shirts. But that&rsquo;s not the
course I lay. I puts it all away, some here, some there,
and none too much anywheres, by reason of suspicion. I&rsquo;m
fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up gentleman
in earnest. Time enough, too, says you. Ah, but I&rsquo;ve
lived easy in the meantime; never denied myself o&rsquo; nothing
heart desires, and slep&rsquo; soft and ate dainty all my days,
but when at sea. And how did I begin? Before the mast,
like you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but all the other money&rsquo;s
gone now, ain&rsquo;t it? You daren&rsquo;t show face in Bristol after
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, where might you suppose it was?&rdquo; asked Silver
derisively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Bristol, in banks and places,&rdquo; answered his companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It were,&rdquo; said the cook; &ldquo;it were when we weighed
anchor. But my old missis has it all by now. And the
&lsquo;Spy-glass&rsquo; is sold, lease and goodwill and rigging; and
the old girl&rsquo;s off to meet me. I would tell you where, for
I trust you; but it &rsquo;ud make jealousy among the
mates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And can you trust your missis?&rdquo; asked the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of fortune,&rdquo; returned the cook, &ldquo;usually
trusts little among themselves, and right they are, you may
lay to it. But I have a way with me, I have. When a
mate brings a slip on his cable&mdash;one as knows me, I mean&mdash;it
won&rsquo;t be in the same world with old John. There was
some that was feared of Pew, and some that was feared of
Flint; but Flint his own self was feared of me. Feared
he was, and proud. They was the roughest crew afloat,
was Flint&rsquo;s; the devil himself would have been feared to
go to sea with them. Well, now, I tell you, I&rsquo;m not a boasting
man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company;
but when I was quartermaster, <i>lambs</i> wasn&rsquo;t the word for
Flint&rsquo;s old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself
in old John&rsquo;s ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell you now,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t half
a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John;
but there&rsquo;s my hand on it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a brave lad you were, and smart too,&rdquo; answered
Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook,
&ldquo;and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never
clapped my eyes on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time I had begun to understand the meaning
of their terms. By a &ldquo;gentleman of fortune&rdquo; they plainly
meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the
little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the
corruption of one of the honest hands&mdash;perhaps of the last
one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved,
for, Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up
and sat down by the party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick&rsquo;s square,&rdquo; said Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know&rsquo;d Dick was square,&rdquo; returned the voice
of the coxswain, Israel Hands. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no fool, is Dick.&rdquo;
And he turned his quid and spat. &ldquo;But, look here,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I want to know, Barbecue: how
long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bum-boat?
I&rsquo;ve had a&rsquo;most enough o&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n Smollett; he&rsquo;s
hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into
that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Israel,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;your head ain&rsquo;t much account,
nor ever was. But you&rsquo;re able to hear, I reckon; leastways,
your ears is big enough. Now, here&rsquo;s what I say:
you&rsquo;ll berth forward, and you&rsquo;ll live hard, and you&rsquo;ll speak
soft, and you&rsquo;ll keep sober, till I give the word; and you
may lay to that, my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t say no, do I?&rdquo; growled the coxswain.
&ldquo;What I say is, when? That&rsquo;s what I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When! by the powers!&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;Well now,
if you want to know, I&rsquo;ll tell you when. The last moment
I can manage; and that&rsquo;s when. Here&rsquo;s a first-rate seaman,
Cap&rsquo;n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here&rsquo;s
this squire and doctor with a map and such&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well, then,
I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help
us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we&rsquo;ll see. If I
was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I&rsquo;d have
Cap&rsquo;n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I
struck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re all seamen aboard here, I should think,&rdquo;
said the lad Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;le hands, you mean,&rdquo; snapped Silver.
&ldquo;We can steer a course, but who&rsquo;s to set one? That&rsquo;s
what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had
my way, I&rsquo;d have Cap&rsquo;n Smollett work us back into the
trades at least; then we&rsquo;d have no blessed miscalculations
and a spoonful of water a day. But I know the sort you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
are. I&rsquo;ll finish with &rsquo;em at the island, as soon&rsquo;s the blunt&rsquo;s
on board, and a pity it is. But you&rsquo;re never happy till
you&rsquo;re drunk. Split my sides, I&rsquo;ve a sick heart to sail with
the likes of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy all, Long John,&rdquo; cried Israel. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a-crossin&rsquo;
of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I
seen laid aboard? and how many brisk lads drying in the
sun at Execution Dock?&rdquo; cried Silver, &ldquo;and all for this
same hurry and hurry and hurry. You hear me? I seen
a thing or two at sea, I have. If you would on&rsquo;y lay your
course, and a p&rsquo;int to windward, you would ride in
carriages, you would. But not you! I know you.
You&rsquo;ll have your mouthful of rum to-morrow, and go
hang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody know&rsquo;d you was a kind of a chapling,
John; but there&rsquo;s others as could hand and steer as well
as you,&rdquo; said Israel. &ldquo;They liked a bit o&rsquo; fun, they did.
They wasn&rsquo;t so high and dry, nohow, but took their fling,
like jolly companions every one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; says Silver. &ldquo;Well, and where are they now?
Pew was of that sort, and he died a beggarman. Flint was,
and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah, they was a sweet
crew, they was! on&rsquo;y, where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Dick, &ldquo;when we do lay &rsquo;em athwart,
what are we to do with &rsquo;em, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the man for me!&rdquo; cried the cook, admiringly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call business. Well, what would you
think? Put &rsquo;em ashore like maroons? That would have
been England&rsquo;s way. Or cut &rsquo;em down like that much
pork? That would have been Flint&rsquo;s or Billy Bones&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Billy was the man for that,&rdquo; said Israel. &ldquo;&lsquo;Dead
men don&rsquo;t bite,&rsquo; says he. Well, he&rsquo;s dead now hisself; he
knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough
hand come to port, it was Billy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;rough and ready. But
mark you here: I&rsquo;m an easy man&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>man,
says you; but this time it&rsquo;s serious. Dooty is dooty,
mates. I give my vote&mdash;death. When I&rsquo;m in Parlyment,
and riding in my coach, I don&rsquo;t want none of these sea-lawyers
in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like
the devil at prayers. Wait is what I say, but when the
time comes, why, let her rip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; cries the coxswain, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll say so, Israel, when you see,&rdquo; said Silver.
&ldquo;Only one thing I claim&mdash;I claim Trelawney. I&rsquo;ll wring
his calf&rsquo;s head off his body with these hands. Dick!&rdquo; he
added, breaking off, &ldquo;you just jump up, like a sweet lad
and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may fancy the terror I was in! I should have
leaped out and run for it, if I had found the strength; but
my limbs and heart alike misgave me. I heard Dick begin
to rise, and then some one seemingly stopped him, and the
voice of Hands exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, stow that! Don&rsquo;t you get sucking of that bilge,
John. Let&rsquo;s have a go of the rum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;I trust you. I&rsquo;ve a gauge on the
keg, mind. There&rsquo;s the key; you fill a pannikin and bring
it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Terrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself
that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong
waters that destroyed him.</p>

<p>Dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence
Israel spoke straight on in the cook&rsquo;s ear. It was but a
word or two that I could catch, and yet I gathered some
important news; for, besides other scraps that tended to
the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: &ldquo;Not
another man of them&rsquo;ll jine.&rdquo; Hence there were still
faithful men on board.</p>

<p>When Dick returned, one after another of the trio took
the pannikin and drank&mdash;one &ldquo;To luck&rdquo;; another with
a &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to old Flint&rdquo;; and Silver himself saying, in a
kind of song, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to ourselves, and hold your luff,
plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel,
and, looking up, I found the moon had risen, and was
silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of
the fore-sail; and almost at the same time the voice of the
look-out shouted &ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo;</p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h5>COUNCIL OF WAR</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a great rush of feet across the deck. I could
hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;le;
and, slipping in an instant outside my barrel, I dived behind
the fore-sail, made a double towards the stern, and
came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and
Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow.</p>

<p>There all hands were already congregated. A belt of
fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance
of the moon. Away to the south-west of us we saw two
low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind
one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still
buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in
figure.</p>

<p>So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet
recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before.
And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing
orders. The <i>Hispaniola</i> was laid a couple of points nearer
the wind, and now sailed a course that would just clear the
island on the east.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, men,&rdquo; said the captain, when all was sheeted
home, &ldquo;has any one of you ever seen that land ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, sir,&rdquo; said Silver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watered there with a
trader I was cook in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I
fancy?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls it. It were a
main place for pirates once, and a hand we had on board
knowed all their names for it. That hill to the nor&rsquo;ard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
they calls the Fore-mast Hill; there are three hills in a row
running south&rsquo;ard&mdash;fore, main, and mizzen, sir. But the
main&mdash;that&rsquo;s the big &rsquo;un with the cloud on it&mdash;they usually
calls the Spy-glass, by reason of a look-out they kept when
they was in the anchorage cleaning; for it&rsquo;s there they
cleaned their ships, sir, asking your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a chart here,&rdquo; says Captain Smollett. &ldquo;See if
that&rsquo;s the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long John&rsquo;s eyes burned in his head as he took the
chart; but, by the fresh look of the paper, I knew he was
doomed to disappointment. This was not the map we
found in Billy Bones&rsquo;s chest, but an accurate copy, complete
in all things&mdash;names and heights and soundings&mdash;with
the single exception of the red crosses and the written
notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had
the strength of mind to hide it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is the spot, to be sure; and
very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I
wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Ay,
here it is: &lsquo;Capt. Kidd&rsquo;s Anchorage&rsquo;&mdash;just the name my
shipmate called it. There&rsquo;s a strong current runs along
the south, and then away nor&rsquo;ard up the west coast. Right
you was, sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to haul your wind and keep the
weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention
as to enter and careen, and there ain&rsquo;t no better place
for that in these waters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my man,&rdquo; says Captain Smollett. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
ask you, later on, to give us a help. You may go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed
his knowledge of the island; and I own I was half-frightened
when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not
know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the
apple-barrel, and yet I had, by this time, taken such a
horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power, that I could
scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;this here is a sweet spot, this island&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on. You&rsquo;ll bathe,
and you&rsquo;ll climb trees, and you&rsquo;ll hunt goats, you will;
and you&rsquo;ll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself. Why,
it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber
leg, I was. It&rsquo;s a pleasant thing to be young, and have
ten toes, and you may lay to that. When you want to
go a bit of exploring, you just ask old John, and he&rsquo;ll put
up a snack for you to take along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the
shoulder, he hobbled off forward, and went below.</p>

<p>Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were
talking together on the quarter-deck, and, anxious as I
was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them
openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts
to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his
side. He had left his pipe below, and, being a slave to
tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as
I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I
broke out immediately: &ldquo;Doctor, let me speak. Get the
captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some
pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor changed countenance a little, but next
moment he was master of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jim,&rdquo; said he, quite loudly, &ldquo;that was all
I wanted to know,&rdquo; as if he had asked me a question.</p>

<p>And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the
other two. They spoke together for a little, and though
none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as
whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated
my request; for the next thing that I heard
was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all
hands were piped on deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lads,&rdquo; said Captain Smollett, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a word to
say to you. This land that we have sighted is the place
we have been sailing to. Mr. Trelawney, being a very
open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just asked
me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
man on board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I never
ask to see it done better, why, he and I and the doctor are
going below to the cabin to drink <i>your</i> health and luck,
and you&rsquo;ll have grog served out for you to drink <i>our</i> health
and luck. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think of this: I think it
handsome. And if you think as I do, you&rsquo;ll give a good
sea cheer for the gentleman that does it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cheer followed&mdash;that was a matter of course; but
it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly
believe these same men were plotting for our blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more cheer for Cap&rsquo;n Smollett,&rdquo; cried Long John,
when the first had subsided.</p>

<p>And this also was given with a will.</p>

<p>On the top of that the three gentlemen went below,
and not long after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins
was wanted in the cabin.</p>

<p>I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle
of Spanish wine and some raisins before them, and the doctor
smoking away, with his wig on his lap, and that, I knew,
was a sign that he was agitated. The stern window was
open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon
shining behind on the ship&rsquo;s wake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Hawkins,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;you have something
to say. Speak up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did as I was bid, and, as short as I could make it,
told the whole details of Silver&rsquo;s conversation. Nobody
interrupted me till I was done, nor did any one of the three
of them make so much as a movement, but they kept their
eyes upon my face from first to last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said Dr. Livesey, &ldquo;take a seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they made me sit down at table beside them,
poured me out a glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins,
and all three, one after the other, and each with a bow,
drank my good health, and their service to me, for my luck
and courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, captain,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;you were right, and
I was wrong. I own myself an ass, and I await your orders.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No more an ass than I, sir,&rdquo; returned the captain.
&ldquo;I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what
showed signs before, for any man that had an eye in his
head to see the mischief and take steps according. But
this crew,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;beats me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;with your permission,
that&rsquo;s Silver. A very remarkable man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir,&rdquo;
returned the captain. &ldquo;But this is talk; this don&rsquo;t lead
to anything. I see three or four points, and with Mr.
Trelawney&rsquo;s permission, I&rsquo;ll name them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, sir, are the captain. It is for you to speak,&rdquo;
says Mr. Trelawney grandly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First point,&rdquo; began Mr. Smollett: &ldquo;we must go on,
because we can&rsquo;t turn back. If I gave the word to go about,
they would rise at once. Second point: we have time
before us&mdash;at least, until this treasure&rsquo;s found. Third
point: there are faithful hands. Now, sir, it&rsquo;s got to come
to blows sooner or later; and what I propose is, to take
time by the forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows
some fine day when they least expect it. We can count,
I take it, on your own home servants, Mr. Trelawney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As upon myself,&rdquo; declared the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; reckoned the captain, &ldquo;ourselves make
seven, counting Hawkins, here. Now, about the honest
hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most likely Trelawney&rsquo;s own men,&rdquo; said the doctor;
&ldquo;those he had picked up for himself, before he lit on Silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the squire, &ldquo;Hands was one of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did think I could have trusted Hands,&rdquo; added the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to think that they&rsquo;re all Englishmen!&rdquo; broke
out the squire. &ldquo;Sir, I could find it in my heart to blow
the ship up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;the best that
I can say is not much. We must lay-to, if you please, and
keep a bright look-out. It&rsquo;s trying on a man, I know. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
would be pleasanter to come to blows. But there&rsquo;s no help
for it till we know our men. Lay-to, and whistle for a wind,
that&rsquo;s my view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim here,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;can help us more than
any one. The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a
noticing lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,&rdquo; added the
squire.</p>

<p>I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether
helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances,
it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime,
talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the
twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of
these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our
side were six to their nineteen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h5>HOW I BEGAN MY SHORE ADVENTURE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> appearance of the island when I came on deck next
morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze
had now utterly failed, we had made a great deal of way
during the night, and were now lying becalmed about half
a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast. Grey-coloured
woods covered a large part of the surface. This
even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sandbreak
in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine
family, out-topping the others&mdash;some singly, some in
clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.
The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of
naked rock. All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass,
which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the
island, was likewise the strangest in configuration, running
up sheer from almost every side, and then suddenly cut off
at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.</p>

<p>The <i>Hispaniola</i> was rolling scuppers under in the ocean
swell. The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder
was banging to and fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning,
and jumping like a manufactory. I had to cling tight
to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my
eyes; for though I was a good enough sailor when there
was way on, this standing still and being rolled about like
a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a
qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty
stomach.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this&mdash;perhaps it was the look of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone
spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming
and thundering on the steep beach&mdash;at least, although the
sun shone bright and hot, and the shore-birds were fishing
and crying all around us, and you would have thought any
one would have been glad to get to land after being so long
at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and
from that first look onward I hated the very thought of
Treasure Island.</p>

<p>We had a dreary morning&rsquo;s work before us, for there
was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out
and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round
the corner of the island, and up the narrow passage to the
haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of
the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat
was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their
work. Anderson was in command of my boat, and instead
of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as loud as the
worst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with an oath, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought this was a very bad sign; for, up to that day,
the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business;
but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords
of discipline.</p>

<p>All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and
conned the ship. He knew the passage like the palm of
his hand; and though the man in the chains got everywhere
more water than was down in the chart, John never hesitated
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strong scour with the ebb,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
this here passage has been dug out, in a manner of speaking,
with a spade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart,
about a third of a mile from either shore, the mainland on
one side, and Skeleton Island on the other. The bottom
was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds
of birds wheeling and crying over the woods; but in less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
than a minute they were down again, and all was once more
silent.</p>

<p>The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods,
the trees coming right down to high-water mark, the shores
mostly flat, and the hill-tops standing round at a distance
in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one there. Two little
rivers, or rather, two swamps, emptied out into this pond,
as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the
shore had a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship
we could see nothing of the house or stockade, for they
were quite buried among trees; and if it had not been for
the chart on the companion, we might have been the first
that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of
the seas.</p>

<p>There was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but
that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches
and against the rocks outside. A peculiar stagnant smell
hung over the anchorage&mdash;a smell of sodden leaves and
rotting tree-trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing and
sniffing, like some one tasting a bad egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about treasure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll stake
my wig there&rsquo;s fever here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat,
it became truly threatening when they had come aboard.
They lay about the deck growling together in talk. The
slightest order was received with a black look, and grudgingly
and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must
have caught the infection, for there was not one man aboard
to mend another. Mutiny, it was plain, hung over us like
a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived
the danger. Long John was hard at work going
from group to group, spending himself in good advice, and
as for example no man could have shown a better. He
fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he
was all smiles to every one. If an order were given, John
would be on his crutch in an instant, with the cheeriest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; in the world; and when there was nothing
else to do, he kept up one song after another, as if to conceal
the discontent of the rest.</p>

<p>Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon,
this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared
the worst.</p>

<p>We held a council in the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;if I risk another order, the
whole ship&rsquo;ll come about our ears by the run. You see,
sir, here it is. I get a rough answer, do I not? Well, if
I speak back, pikes will be going in two shakes; if I don&rsquo;t,
Silver will see there&rsquo;s something under that, and the game&rsquo;s
up. Now, we&rsquo;ve only one man to rely on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is that?&rdquo; asked the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silver, sir,&rdquo; returned the captain; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s as anxious
as you and I to smother things up. This is a tiff; he&rsquo;d
soon talk &rsquo;em out of it if he had the chance, and what I propose
to do is to give him the chance. Let&rsquo;s allow the men
an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why, we&rsquo;ll fight the
ship. If they none of them go&mdash;well, then, we hold the
cabin, and God defend the right. If some go, you mark
my words, sir, Silver&rsquo;ll bring &rsquo;em aboard again as mild as
lambs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to
all the sure men; Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken
into our confidence, and received the news with less surprise
and a better spirit than we had looked for, and then the
captain went on deck and addressed the crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lads,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had a hot day, and are
all tired and out of sorts. A turn ashore&rsquo;ll hurt nobody&mdash;the
boats are still in the water; you can take the gigs,
and as many as please can go ashore for the afternoon.
I&rsquo;ll fire a gun half an hour before sun-down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would
break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed;
for they all came out of their sulks in a moment, and gave
a cheer that started the echo in a far-away hill, and sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage.</p>

<p>The captain was too bright to be in the way. He
whipped out of sight in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange
the party; and I fancy it was as well he did so. Had he
been on deck he could no longer so much as have pretended
not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day.
Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he
had of it. The honest hands&mdash;and I was soon to see it
proved that there were such on board&mdash;must have been
very stupid fellows. Or, rather, I suppose the truth was
this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the
ringleaders&mdash;only some more, some less; and a few, being
good fellows in the main, could neither be led nor driven
any further. It is one thing to be idle and skulk, and quite
another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent
men.</p>

<p>At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows
were to stay on board, and the remaining thirteen, including
Silver, began to embark.</p>

<p>Then it was that there came into my head the first of
the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives.
If six men were left by Silver, it was plain our party could
not take and fight the ship; and since only six were left,
it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present
need of my assistance. It occurred to me at once to go
ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side, and curled
up in the foresheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the
same moment she shoved off.</p>

<p>No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying,
&ldquo;Is that you, Jim? Keep your head down.&rdquo; But Silver,
from the other boat, looked sharply over and called out to
know if that were me; and from that moment I began to
regret what I had done.</p>

<p>The crews raced for the beach; but the boat I was in,
having some start, and being at once the lighter and the
better manned, shot far ahead of her consort, and the bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
had struck among the shore-side trees, and I had caught
a branch and swung myself out, and plunged into the nearest
thicket, while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards
behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, Jim!&rdquo; I heard him shouting.</p>

<p>But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking,
and breaking through, I ran straight before my nose,
till I could run no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h5>THE FIRST BLOW</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">I was</span> so pleased at having given the slip to Long John,
that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some
interest on the strange land that I was in.</p>

<p>I had crossed a marshy track full of willows, bulrushes,
and odd, outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come
out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating, sandy
country, about a mile long, dotted with a few pines, and a
great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak in
growth, but pale in foliage, like willows. On the far side
of the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy
peaks, shining vividly in the sun.</p>

<p>I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The
isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and
nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls.
I turned hither and thither among the trees. Here and
there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there
I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock
and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a
top. Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy, and
that the noise was the famous rattle.</p>

<p>Then I came to a long thicket of these oak-like trees&mdash;live,
or evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be
called&mdash;which grew low along the sand like brambles, the
boughs curiously twisted, the foliage compact, like thatch.
The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy
knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until it
reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which
the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
anchorage. The marsh was steaming in the strong sun,
and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze.</p>

<p>All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the
bulrushes; a wild duck flew up with a quack, another
followed, and soon over the whole surface of the marsh
a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the
air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be
drawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I
deceived; for soon I heard the very distant and low tones
of a human voice, which, as I continued to give ear, grew
steadily louder and nearer.</p>

<p>This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover
of the nearest live-oak, and squatted there, hearkening, as
silent as a mouse.</p>

<p>Another voice answered; and then the first voice,
which I now recognised to be Silver&rsquo;s, once more took up
the story, and ran on for a long while in a stream, only now
and again interrupted by the other. By the sound they
must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely;
but no distinct word came to my hearing.</p>

<p>At last the speakers seemed to have paused, and perhaps
to have sat down; for not only did they cease to draw any
nearer, but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet,
and to settle again to their places in the swamp.</p>

<p>And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business;
that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore
with these desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear
them at their councils; and that my plain and obvious duty
was to draw as close as I could manage, under the favourable
ambush of the crouching trees.</p>

<p>I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly,
not only by the sound of their voices, but by the behaviour
of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads
of the intruders.</p>

<p>Crawling on all-fours, I made steadily but slowly towards
them; till at last, raising my head to an aperture
among the leaves, I could see clear down into a little green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
dell beside the marsh, and closely set about with trees,
where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face
to face in conversation.</p>

<p>The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his
hat beside him on the ground, and his great, smooth, blonde
face, all shining with heat, was lifted to the other man&rsquo;s
in a kind of appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mate,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because I thinks gold
dust of you&mdash;gold dust, and you may lay to that! If I
hadn&rsquo;t took to you like pitch, do you think I&rsquo;d have been
here a-warning of you? All&rsquo;s up&mdash;you can&rsquo;t make nor
mend; it&rsquo;s to save your neck that I&rsquo;m a-speaking, and if
one of the wild &rsquo;uns knew it, where &rsquo;ud I be, Tom&mdash;now,
tell me, where &rsquo;ud I be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silver,&rdquo; said the other man&mdash;and I observed he was
not only red in the face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and
his voice shook, too, like a taut rope&mdash;&ldquo;Silver,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re old, and you&rsquo;re honest, or has the name for it;
and you&rsquo;ve money, too, which lots of poor sailors hasn&rsquo;t;
and you&rsquo;re brave, or I&rsquo;m mistook. And will you tell me
you&rsquo;ll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of
swabs? not you! As sure as God sees me, I&rsquo;d sooner lose
my hand. If I turn agin my dooty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise.
I had found one of the honest hands&mdash;well, here, at that
same moment, came news of another. Far away out in
the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound like the cry
of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one
horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass
re-echoed it a score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds
rose again, darkening heaven, with a simultaneous
whirr; and long after that death-yell was still ringing in
my brain silence had re-established its empire, and only
the rustle of the re-descending birds and the boom of the
distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur;
but Silver had not winked an eye. He stood where he was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
resting lightly on his crutch, watching his companion like
a snake about to spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; said the sailor, stretching out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands off!&rdquo; cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it
seemed to me, with the speed and security of a trained
gymnast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands off, if you like, John Silver,&rdquo; said the other.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a black conscience that can make you feared of me.
But, in heaven&rsquo;s name, tell me what was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; returned Silver, smiling away, but warier
than ever, his eye a mere pin-point in his big face, but
gleaming like a crumb of glass. &ldquo;That? Oh, I reckon
that&rsquo;ll be Alan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at this poor Tom flashed out like a hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alan!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Then rest his soul for a true seaman!
And as for you, John Silver, long you&rsquo;ve been a
mate of mine, but you&rsquo;re mate of mine no more. If I die
like a dog, I&rsquo;ll die in my dooty. You&rsquo;ve killed Alan, have
you? Kill me, too, if you can. But I defies you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that this brave fellow turned his back directly
on the cook, and set off walking for the beach. But he
was not destined to go far. With a cry, John seized the
branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of his arm-pit,
and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.
It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning
violence, right between the shoulders in the middle of his
back. His hands flew up, he gave a sort of gasp, and fell.</p>

<p>Whether he were injured much or little, none could ever
tell. Like enough, to judge from the sound, his back was
broken on the spot. But he had no time given him to recover.
Silver, agile as a monkey, even without leg or
crutch, was on the top of him next moment, and had twice
buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body.
From my place of ambush I could hear him pant aloud as
he struck the blows.</p>

<p>I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know
that for the next little while the whole world swam away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
from before me in a whirling mist; Silver and the birds,
and the tall Spy-glass hill-top, going round and round and
topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells ringing
and distant voices shouting in my ear.</p>

<p>When I came again to myself, the monster had pulled
himself together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his
head. Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the
sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing
his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.
Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly
on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the
mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder
had been actually done, and a human life cruelly cut short,
a moment since, before my eyes.</p>

<p>But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought
out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts,
that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of
course, the meaning of the signal; but it instantly awoke
my fears. More men would be coming. I might be discovered.
They had already slain two of the honest people;
after Tom and Alan, might not I come next?</p>

<p>Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back
again, with what speed and silence I could manage, to the
more open portion of the wood. As I did so, I could hear
hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his
comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As
soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before,
scarce minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led
me from the murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew
upon me, until it turned into a kind of frenzy.</p>

<p>Indeed, could any one be more entirely lost than I?
When the gun fired, how should I dare to go down to the
boats among those fiends, still smoking from their crime?
Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck
like a snipe&rsquo;s? Would not my absence itself be an evidence
to them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge?
It was all over, I thought. Good-bye to the <i>Hispaniola</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
good-bye to the squire, the doctor, and the captain! There
was nothing left for me but death by starvation, or death
by the hands of the mutineers.</p>

<p>All this while, as I say, I was still running, and, without
taking any notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little
hill with the two peaks, and had got into a part of the
island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart, and
seemed more like forest-trees in their bearing and dimensions.
Mingled with these were a few scattered pines,
some fifty, some nearer seventy, feet high. The air, too,
smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh.</p>

<p>And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with
a thumping heart.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h5>THE MAN OF THE ISLAND</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">From</span> the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony,
a spout of gravel was dislodged, and fell rattling and bounding
through the trees. My eyes turned instinctively in
that direction, and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity
behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether bear or
man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark
and shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new
apparition brought me to a stand.</p>

<p>I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind
me the murderers, before me this lurking nondescript.
And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew
to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared less terrible
in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned
on my heel, and, looking sharply behind me over my
shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of the
boats.</p>

<p>Instantly the figure reappeared, and, making a wide
circuit, began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate;
but had I been as fresh as when I rose, I could see it was
in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary.
From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running
man-like on two legs, but, unlike any man that I had ever
seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was;
I could no longer be in doubt about that.</p>

<p>I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was
within an ace of calling for help. But the mere fact that
he was a man, however wild, had somewhat reassured
me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method
of escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my
pistol flashed into my mind. As soon as I remembered
I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart;
and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island, and
walked briskly towards him.</p>

<p>He was concealed by this time behind another tree-trunk;
but he must have been watching me closely, for
as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared
and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated, drew back,
came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and confusion,
threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped
hands in supplication.</p>

<p>At that I once more stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben Gunn,&rdquo; he answered, and his voice sounded
hoarse and awkward, like a rusty lock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poor Ben
Gunn, I am; and I haven&rsquo;t spoke with a Christian these
three years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could now see that he was a white man like myself,
and that his features were even pleasing. His skin, where-ever
it was exposed, was burnt by the sun; even his lips
were black; and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so
dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or
fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed
with tatters of old ship&rsquo;s canvas and old sea cloth; and this
extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system
of the most various and incongruous fastenings,&mdash;brass
buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin. About
his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which
was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three years!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Were you shipwrecked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, mate,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;marooned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible
kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers,
in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and
shot, and left behind on some desolate and distant island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Marooned three years agone,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and
lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters. Where-ever
a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate,
my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn&rsquo;t happen
to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well,
many&rsquo;s the long night I&rsquo;ve dreamed of cheese&mdash;toasted,
mostly&mdash;and woke up again, and here I were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever I can get aboard again,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you shall
have cheese by the stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket,
smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally,
in the intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure
in the presence of a fellow-creature. But at my last words
he perked up into a kind of startled slyness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever you can get aboard again, says you?&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;Why, now, who&rsquo;s to hinder you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you, I know,&rdquo; was my reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And right you was,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Now you&mdash;what do
you call yourself, mate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; I told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, Jim,&rdquo; says he, quite pleased, apparently. &ldquo;Well,
now, Jim, I&rsquo;ve lived that rough as you&rsquo;d be ashamed to
hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn&rsquo;t think I had had
a pious mother&mdash;to look at me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no&mdash;not in particular,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I had&mdash;remarkable pious.
And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism
that fast as you couldn&rsquo;t tell one word from another.
And here&rsquo;s what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen
on the blessed grave-stones! That&rsquo;s what it begun
with, but it went further&rsquo;n that; and so my mother told
me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman!
But it were Providence that put me here. I&rsquo;ve thought
it all out in this here lonely island, and I&rsquo;m back on piety.
You don&rsquo;t catch me tasting rum so much; but just a
thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I&rsquo;m
bound I&rsquo;ll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>&mdash;looking
all round him, and lowering his voice to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in
his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling
in my face; for he repeated the statement hotly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rich! rich! I says. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what: I&rsquo;ll
make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you&rsquo;ll bless your stars,
you will, you was the first that found me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow
over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand,
and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain&rsquo;t Flint&rsquo;s ship?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe
that I had found an ally, and I answered him at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Flint&rsquo;s ship, and Flint is dead; but I&rsquo;ll tell
you true, as you ask me&mdash;there are some of Flint&rsquo;s hands
aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a man&mdash;with one&mdash;leg?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silver?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Silver!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;that were his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the cook; and the ringleader, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he
gave it quite a wring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you was sent by Long John,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as
good as pork, and I know it. But where was you, do you
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of
answer told him the whole story of our voyage, and the predicament
in which we found ourselves. He heard me with
the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on
the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good lad, Jim,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re all
in a clove hitch, ain&rsquo;t you? Well, you just put your trust
in Ben Gunn&mdash;Ben Gunn&rsquo;s the man to do it. Would you
think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>minded
one in case of help&mdash;him being in a clove hitch, as
you remark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him the squire was the most liberal of
men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but you see,&rdquo; returned Ben Gunn, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean giving me a gate to keep, and a shuit of livery-clothes,
and such; that&rsquo;s not my mark, Jim. What I mean is,
would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one
thousand pounds out of money that&rsquo;s as good as a man&rsquo;s
own already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure he would,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;As it was, all hands
were to share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>And</i> a passage home?&rdquo; he added, with a look of great
shrewdness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;the squire&rsquo;s a gentleman. And,
besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to
help work the vessel home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so you would.&rdquo; And he seemed very
much relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;So much
I&rsquo;ll tell you, and no more. I were in Flint&rsquo;s ship when
he buried the treasure; he and six along&mdash;six strong seamen.
They was ashore nigh on a week, and us standing
off and on in the old <i>Walrus</i>. One fine day up went the
signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and
his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up,
and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But,
there he was, you mind, and the six all dead&mdash;dead and
buried. How he done it not a man aboard us could make
out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways&mdash;him
against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John,
he was quarter-master; and they asked him where the
treasure was. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you can go ashore, if you
like, and stay,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;but as for the ship, she&rsquo;ll beat
up for more, by thunder!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we
sighted this island. &lsquo;Boys,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s Flint&rsquo;s treasure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
let&rsquo;s land and find it.&rsquo; The cap&rsquo;n was displeased at that;
but my messmates were all of a mind, and landed. Twelve
days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse
word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard.
&lsquo;As for you, Benjamin Gunn,&rsquo; says they, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a musket,&rsquo;
they says, &lsquo;and a spade, and pickaxe. You can stay here
and find Flint&rsquo;s money for yourself,&rsquo; they says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite
of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look
here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast?
No, says you. Nor I weren&rsquo;t neither, I says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he winked and pinched me hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim&rdquo;&mdash;he
went on: &ldquo;Nor he weren&rsquo;t, neither&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
words. Three years he were the man of this island, light
and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would, maybe,
think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would,
maybe, think of his old mother, so be as she&rsquo;s alive (you&rsquo;ll
say); but the most part of Gunn&rsquo;s time (this is what you&rsquo;ll
say)&mdash;the most part of his time was took up with another
matter. And then you&rsquo;ll give him a nip, like I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he pinched me again in the most confidential
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;&ldquo;then you&rsquo;ll up, and you&rsquo;ll
say this:&mdash;Gunn is a good man (you&rsquo;ll say), and he puts a
precious sight more confidence&mdash;a precious sight, mind that&mdash;in
a gen&rsquo;leman born than in these gen&rsquo;lemen of fortune,
having been one hisself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand one word that
you&rsquo;ve been saying. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there;
for how am I to get on board?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the hitch, for sure. Well,
there&rsquo;s my boat, that I made with my two hands. I keep
her under the white rock. If the worst come to the worst,
we might try that after dark.&mdash;Hi!&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For just then, although the sun had still an hour or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
to run, all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed
to the thunder of a cannon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have begun to fight!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors
all forgotten; while, close at my side, the marooned man
in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left, left,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;keep to your left hand, mate
Jim! Under the trees with you! Theer&rsquo;s where I killed
my first goat. They don&rsquo;t come down here now; they&rsquo;re
all mast-headed on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin
Gunn. Ah! and there&rsquo;s the cetemery&rdquo;&mdash;cemetery, he
must have meant. &ldquo;You see the mounds? I come here
and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a
Sunday would be about doo. It weren&rsquo;t quite a chapel,
but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben
Gunn was short-handed&mdash;no chapling, nor so much as a
Bible and a flag you says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving
any answer.</p>

<p>The cannon-shot was followed, after a considerable
interval, by a volley of small arms.</p>

<p>Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in
front of me, I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above
a wood.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h5>NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR&mdash;HOW THE<br />
SHIP WAS ABANDONED</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">It</span> was about half-past one&mdash;three bells in the sea phrase&mdash;that
the two boats went ashore from the <i>Hispaniola</i>.
The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over
in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind we should
have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with
us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was
wanting; and, to complete our helplessness, down came
Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into
a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.</p>

<p>It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins; but
we were alarmed for his safety. With the men in the
temper they were in, it seemed an even chance if we should
see the lad again. We ran on deck. The pitch was bubbling
in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned
me sick; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was
in that abominable anchorage. The six scoundrels were
sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle; ashore we
could see the gigs made fast, and a man sitting in each,
hard by where the river runs in. One of them was whistling
&ldquo;Lillibullero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waiting was a strain; and it was decided that Hunter
and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat, in quest of information.</p>

<p>The gigs had leaned to their right; but Hunter and I
pulled straight in, in the direction of the stockade upon
the chart. The two who were left guarding their boats
seemed in a bustle at our appearance; &ldquo;Lillibullero&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what they
ought to do. Had they gone and told Silver, all might
have turned out differently; but they had their orders, I
suppose, and decided to sit quietly where they were and
hark back again to &ldquo;Lillibullero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so
as to put it between us; even before we landed we had thus
lost sight of the gigs. I jumped out, and came as near
running as I durst, with a big silk handkerchief under my
hat for coolness&rsquo; sake, and a brace of pistols ready primed for
safety.</p>

<p>I had not gone a hundred yards when I came on the
stockade.</p>

<p>This was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost
at the top of a knoll. Well, on the knoll, and enclosing
the spring, they had clapped a stout log-house, fit to hold
two-score people on a pinch, and loopholed for musketry
on every side. All round this they had cleared a wide
space, and then the thing was completed by a paling six
feet high, without door or opening, too strong to pull down
without time and labour, and too open to shelter the
besiegers. The people in the log-house had them in every
way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like
partridges. All they wanted was a good watch and food;
for, short of a complete surprise, they might have held
the place against a regiment.</p>

<p>What particularly took my fancy was the spring. For,
though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of
the <i>Hispaniola</i>, with plenty of arms and ammunition, and
things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been one thing
overlooked&mdash;we had no water. I was thinking this over,
when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man
at the point of death. I was not new to violent death&mdash;I
have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland,
and got a wound myself at Fontenoy&mdash;but I know my pulse
went dot and carry one. &ldquo;Jim Hawkins is gone&rdquo; was
my first thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>It is something to have been an old soldier, but more
still to have been a doctor. There is no time to dilly-dally
in our work. And so now I made up my mind instantly,
and with no time lost returned to the shore, and jumped
on board the jolly-boat.</p>

<p>By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar. We made
the water fly; and the boat was soon alongside, and I
aboard the schooner.</p>

<p>I found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire
was sitting down, as white as a sheet, thinking of the harm
he had led us to, the good soul! and one of the six forecastle
hands was little better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man,&rdquo; says Captain Smollett, nodding
towards him, &ldquo;new to this work. He came nigh-hand
fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry. Another touch
of the rudder and that man would join us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled
on the details of its accomplishment.</p>

<p>We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin
and the forecastle, with three or four loaded muskets and
a mattress for protection. Hunter brought the boat round
under the stern-port, and Joyce and I set to work loading
her with powder-tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of
pork, a cask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine-chest.</p>

<p>In the meantime the squire and the captain stayed on
deck, and the latter hailed the coxswain, who was the
principal man aboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hands,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here are two of us with a brace
of pistols each. If any one of you six make a signal of any
description, that man&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were a good deal taken aback; and, after a little
consultation, one and all tumbled down the fore companion,
thinking, no doubt, to take us on the rear. But when they
saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred gallery, they
went about-ship at once, and a head popped out again on
deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down, dog!&rdquo; cries the captain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>And the head popped back again; and we heard no
more, for the time, of these six very faint-hearted seamen.</p>

<p>By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had
the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I
got out through the stern-port, and we made for shore again,
as fast as oars could take us.</p>

<p>This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore.
&ldquo;Lillibullero&rdquo; was dropped again; and just before we
lost sight of them behind the little point, one of them
whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a mind to
change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that
Silver and the others might be close at hand, and all might
very well be lost by trying for too much.</p>

<p>We had soon touched land in the same place as before,
and set to provision the block-house. All three made the
first journey, heavily laden, and tossed our stores over the
palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to guard them&mdash;one man,
to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets&mdash;Hunter and I
returned to the jolly-boat, and loaded ourselves once more.
So we proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the
whole cargo was bestowed, when the two servants took up
their positions in the block-house, and I, with all my power,
sculled back to the <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<p>That we should have risked a second boat-load seems
more daring than it really was. They had the advantage
of numbers, of course, but we had the advantage of arms.
Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before they
could get within range for pistol-shooting, we flattered
ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen
at least.</p>

<p>The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all
his faintness gone from him. He caught the painter and
made it fast, and we fell to loading the boat for our very
lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the cargo, with only
a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and
Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder
we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us
in the sun, on the clean sandy bottom.</p>

<p>By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the
ship was swinging round to her anchor. Voices were heard
faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs; and
though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter, who were
well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.</p>

<p>Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery, and
dropped into the boat, which we then brought round to
the ship&rsquo;s counter, to be handier for Captain Smollett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no answer from the forecastle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to you, Abraham Gray&mdash;it&rsquo;s to you I am speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gray,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, &ldquo;I am
leaving this ship, and I order you to follow your captain.
I know you are a good man at bottom, and I daresay not
one of the lot of you&rsquo;s as bad as he makes out. I have my
watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join
me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my fine fellow,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
hang so long in stays. I&rsquo;m risking my life, and the lives
of these good gentlemen, every second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out
burst Abraham Gray with a knife-cut on the side of the
cheek, and came running to the captain, like a dog to the
whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>And the next moment he and the captain had dropped
aboard of us, and we had shoved off and given way.</p>

<p>We were clear out of the ship; but not yet ashore in
our stockade.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<h5>NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR&mdash;THE<br />
JOLLY-BOAT&rsquo;S LAST TRIP</h5>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">This</span> fifth trip was quite different from any of the others.
In the first place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were
in was gravely overloaded. Five grown men, and three
of them&mdash;Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain&mdash;over six
feet high, was already more than she was meant to carry.
Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale
was lipping astern. Several times we shipped a little
water, and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all
soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards.</p>

<p>The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to
lie a little more evenly. All the same, we were afraid to
breathe.</p>

<p>In the second place, the ebb was now making&mdash;a strong
rippling current running westward through the basin, and
then south&rsquo;ard and seaward down the straits by which we
had entered in the morning. Even the ripples were a danger
to our overloaded craft; but the worst of it was that we
were swept out of our true course, and away from our
proper landing-place behind the point. If we let the current
have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs, where
the pirates might appear at any moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,&rdquo; said I
to the captain. I was steering, while he and Redruth, two
fresh men, were at the oars. &ldquo;The tide keeps washing her
down. Could you pull a little stronger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not without swamping the boat,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You
must bear up, sir, if you please&mdash;bear up till you see you&rsquo;re
gaining.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>I tried, and found by experiment that the tide kept
sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east,
or just about right angles to the way we ought to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get ashore at this rate,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the only course that we can lie, sir, we must
even lie it,&rdquo; returned the captain. &ldquo;We must keep upstream.
You see, sir,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if once we dropped
to leeward of the landing-place, it&rsquo;s hard to say where we
should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by
the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken,
and then we can dodge back along the shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The current&rsquo;s less a&rsquo;ready, sir,&rdquo; said the man Gray,
who was sitting in the foresheets; &ldquo;you can ease her off a
bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my man,&rdquo; said I, quite as if nothing had
happened: for we had all quietly made up our minds to
treat him like one of ourselves.</p>

<p>Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his
voice was a little changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gun!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that,&rdquo; said I, for I made sure he
was thinking of a bombardment of the fort. &ldquo;They could
never get the gun ashore, and if they did, they could never
haul it through the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look astern, doctor,&rdquo; replied the captain.</p>

<p>We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to
our horror, were the five rogues busy about her, getting
off her jacket, as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under
which she sailed. Not only that, but it flashed into my
mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the
powder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with
an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones
aboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Israel was Flint&rsquo;s gunner,&rdquo; said Gray hoarsely.</p>

<p>At any risk, we put the boat&rsquo;s head direct for the landing-place.
By this time we had got so far out of the run of the
current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
gentle rate of rowing, and I could keep her steady for the
goal. But the worst of it was, that with the course I now
held, we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the
<i>Hispaniola</i>, and offered a target like a barn-door.</p>

<p>I could hear, as well as see, that brandy-faced rascal,
Israel Hands, plumping down a round-shot on the
deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the best shot?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trelawney, out and away,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of
these men, sir? Hands, if possible,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the
priming of his gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried the captain, &ldquo;easy with that gun, sir,
or you&rsquo;ll swamp the boat. All hands stand by to trim her
when he aims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we
leaned over to the other side to keep the balance, and all
was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop.</p>

<p>They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the
swivel, and Hands, who was at the muzzle with the rammer,
was, in consequence, the most exposed. However, we had
no luck; for just as Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the
ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four who
fell.</p>

<p>The cry he gave was echoed, not only by his companions
on board, but by a great number of voices from the shore,
and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping
out from among the trees and tumbling into their places
in the boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here come the gigs, sir,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give way then,&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t
mind if we swamp her now. If we can&rsquo;t get ashore, all&rsquo;s
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,&rdquo; I added,
&ldquo;the crew of the other most likely going round by shore
to cut us off.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have a hot run, sir,&rdquo; returned the captain.
&ldquo;Jack ashore, you know. It&rsquo;s not them I mind; it&rsquo;s the
round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady&rsquo;s maid couldn&rsquo;t
miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we&rsquo;ll
hold water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a
good pace for a boat so overloaded, and we had shipped
but little water in the process. We were now close in;
thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her; for the
ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the
clustering trees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the
little point had already concealed it from our eyes. The
ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed us, was now making
reparation, and delaying our assailants. The one source
of danger was the gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I durst,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d stop and pick off
another man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay
their shot. They had never so much as looked at their
fallen comrade, though he was not dead, and I could see
him trying to crawl away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; cried the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried the captain, quick as an echo.</p>

<p>And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that
sent her stern bodily under water. The report fell in at
the same instant of time. This was the first that Jim
heard, the sound of the squire&rsquo;s shot not having reached
him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew;
but I fancy it must have been over our heads, and that the
wind of it may have contributed to our disaster.</p>

<p>At any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently,
in three feet of water, leaving the captain and myself,
facing each other, on our feet. The other three took complete
headers, and came up again, drenched and bubbling.</p>

<p>So far there was no great harm. No lives were lost,
and we could wade ashore in safety. But there were all
our stores at the bottom, and, to make things worse, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
two guns out of five remained in a state for service. Mine
I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by
a sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his
over his shoulder by a bandoleer, and, like a wise man, lock
uppermost. The other three had gone down with the boat.</p>

<p>To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing
near us in the woods along shore; and we had not only the
danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled
state, but the fear before us whether, if Hunter and Joyce
were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the sense
and conduct to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we
knew; Joyce was a doubtful case&mdash;a pleasant, polite man
for a valet, and to brush one&rsquo;s clothes, but not entirely
fitted for a man of war.</p>

<p>With all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as
we could, leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat, and a good
half of all our powder and provisions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h5>NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR&mdash;END<br />
OF THE FIRST DAY&rsquo;S FIGHTING</h5>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">We</span> made our best speed across the strip of wood that now
divided us from the stockade; and at every step we took
the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer. Soon we could
hear their footfalls as they ran, and the cracking of the
branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.</p>

<p>I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest,
and looked to my priming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Trelawney is the dead shot. Give
him your gun; his own is useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool
as he had been since the beginning of the bustle, hung a
moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service. At
the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I handed
him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit
in his hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through
the air. It was plain from every line of his body that our
new hand was worth his salt.</p>

<p>Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood
and saw the stockade in front of us. We struck the enclosure
about the middle of the south side, and, almost at
the same time, seven mutineers&mdash;Job Anderson, the boatswain,
at their head&mdash;appeared in full cry at the south-western
corner.</p>

<p>They paused, as if taken aback; and before they recovered,
not only the squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce
from the block-house, had time to fire. The four shots
came in rather a scattering volley; but they did the busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>ness:
one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without
hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.</p>

<p>After reloading, we walked down the outside of the
palisade to see to the fallen enemy. He was stone dead&mdash;shot
through the heart.</p>

<p>We began to rejoice over our good success, when just
at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled
close past my ear, and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and
fell his length on the ground. Both the squire and I returned
the shot; but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable
we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded, and turned
our attention to poor Tom.</p>

<p>The captain and Gray were already examining him;
and I saw with half an eye that all was over.</p>

<p>I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered
the mutineers once more, for we were suffered without
further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted
over the stockade, and carried, groaning and bleeding, into
the log-house.</p>

<p>Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise,
complaint, fear, or even acquiescence, from the very beginning
of our troubles till now, when we had laid him down
in the log-house to die. He had lain like a Trojan behind
his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order
silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party
by a score of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant,
it was he that was to die.</p>

<p>The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and
kissed his hand, crying like a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be I going, doctor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, my man,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;say you forgive me, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that be respectful like, from me to you,
squire?&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Howsoever, so be it&mdash;amen!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody
might read a prayer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the custom, sir,&rdquo; he
added apologetically. And not long after, without another
word, he passed away.</p>

<p>In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to
be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets, had
turned out a great many various stores&mdash;the British colours,
a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink, the log-book, and
pounds of tobacco. He had found a longish fir-tree lying
felled and cleared in the enclosure, and, with the help of
Hunter, he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where
the trunks crossed and made an angle. Then, climbing
on the roof, he had with his own hand bent and run up the
colours.</p>

<p>This seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered
the log-house, and set about counting up the stores, as if
nothing else existed. But he had an eye on Tom&rsquo;s passage
for all that; and as soon as all was over, came forward with
another flag, and reverently spread it on the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take on, sir,&rdquo; he said, shaking the squire&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well with him; no fear for a hand that&rsquo;s
been shot down in his duty to captain and owner. It
mayn&rsquo;t be good divinity, but it&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he pulled me aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Livesey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in how many weeks do you
and squire expect the consort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him it was a question, not of weeks, but of months;
that if we were not back by the end of August, Blandly
was to send to find us; but neither sooner nor later. &ldquo;You
can calculate for yourself,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; returned the captain, scratching his head,
&ldquo;and making a large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence,
I should say we were pretty close hauled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That&rsquo;s
what I mean,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;As for powder and
shot, we&rsquo;ll do. But the rations are short, very short&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
short, Doctor Livesey, that we&rsquo;re perhaps as well without
that extra mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he pointed to the dead body under the flag.</p>

<p>Just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed
high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond
us in the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Blaze away! You&rsquo;ve
little enough powder already, my lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball
descended inside the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand,
but doing no further damage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;the house is quite invisible
from the ship. It must be the flag they are aiming at.
Would it not be wiser to take it in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike my colours!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;No, sir,
not I;&rdquo; and, as soon as he had said the words I think we
all agreed with him. For it was not only a piece of stout,
seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy besides, and
showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.</p>

<p>All through the evening they kept thundering away.
Ball after ball flew over or fell short, or kicked up the sand
in the enclosure; but they had to fire so high that the shot
fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand. We had no
ricochet to fear; and though one popped in through the
roof of the log-house, and out again through the floor, we
soon got used to that sort of horse-play, and minded it no
more than cricket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing good about all this,&rdquo; observed the
captain: &ldquo;the wood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb
has made a good while; our stores should be uncovered.
Volunteers to go and bring in pork!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well
armed, they stole out of the stockade; but it proved a
fruitless mission. The mutineers were bolder than we
fancied, or they put more trust in Israel&rsquo;s gunnery. For
four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores, and
wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current.
Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man
of them was now provided with a musket from some secret
magazine of their own.</p>

<p>The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning
of the entry:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship&rsquo;s
doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter&rsquo;s mate; John Trelawney,
owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce, owner&rsquo;s servants,
landsmen&mdash;being all that is left faithful of the ship&rsquo;s company&mdash;with
stores for ten days at short rations, came ashore
this day, and flew British colours on the log-house in
Treasure Island. Thomas Redruth, owner&rsquo;s servant, landsman,
shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at the same time I was wondering over poor Jim
Hawkins&rsquo;s fate.</p>

<p>A hail on the land side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody hailing us,&rdquo; said Hunter, who was on
guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor! squire! captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that
you?&rdquo; came the cries.</p>

<p>And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe
and sound, come climbing over the stockade.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<h5>NARRATIVE RESUMED BY JIM HAWKINS&mdash;THE<br />
GARRISON IN THE STOCKADE</h5>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt,
stopped me by the arm, and sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your friends, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far more likely it&rsquo;s the mutineers,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, in a place like this, where
nobody puts in but gen&rsquo;lemen of fortune, Silver would
fly the Jolly Roger, you don&rsquo;t make no doubt of that. No;
that&rsquo;s your friends. There&rsquo;s been blows, too, and I reckon
your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore
in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by
Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint!
Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid
of none, not he; on&rsquo;y Silver&mdash;Silver was that genteel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that may be so, and so be it; all the
more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, mate,&rdquo; returned Ben, &ldquo;not you. You&rsquo;re a
good boy, or I&rsquo;m mistook: but you&rsquo;re on&rsquo;y a boy, all told.
Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn&rsquo;t bring me there,
where you&rsquo;re going&mdash;not rum wouldn&rsquo;t, till I see your born
gen&rsquo;leman, and gets it on his word of honour. And you
won&rsquo;t forget my words: &lsquo;A precious sight (that&rsquo;s what
you&rsquo;ll say), a precious sight more confidence&rsquo;&mdash;and then
nips him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he pinched me the third time with the same air of
cleverness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to
find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him to-day. And
him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
he&rsquo;s to come alone. O, and you&rsquo;ll say this: &lsquo;Ben Gunn,&rsquo;
says you, &lsquo;has reasons of his own.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I believe I understand. You have
something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or
the doctor; and you&rsquo;re to be found where I found you. Is
that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when? says you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Why, from
about noon observation to about six bells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and now may I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget?&rdquo; he inquired anxiously. &ldquo;Precious
sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his
own; that&rsquo;s the mainstay; as between man and man.
Well, then&rdquo;&mdash;still holding me&mdash;&ldquo;I reckon you can go,
Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn&rsquo;t go
for to sell Ben Gunn? wild horses wouldn&rsquo;t draw it from
you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore,
Jim, what would you say but there&rsquo;d be widders in the
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannon-ball
came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand,
not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The
next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different
direction.</p>

<p>For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the
island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I
moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued,
or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles. But
towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst
not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls
fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my
heart again; and after a long detour to the east, crept down
among the shoreside trees.</p>

<p>The sun had just set, the sea-breeze was rustling and
tumbling in the woods, and ruffling the grey surface of the
anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of
sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat of the day,
chilled me through my jacket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Hispaniola</i> still lay where she had anchored; but,
sure enough, there was the Jolly Roger&mdash;the black flag
of piracy&mdash;flying from her peak. Even as I looked, there
came another red flash and another report, that sent the
echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through
the air. It was the last of the cannonade.</p>

<p>I lay for some time, watching the bustle which succeeded
the attack. Men were demolishing something with
axes on the beach near the stockade; the poor jolly-boat,
I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the
river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between
that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and
going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at
the oars like children. But there was a sound in their
voices which suggested rum.</p>

<p>At length I thought I might return towards the stockade.
I was pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses
the anchorage to the east, and is joined at half-water to
Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some
distance further down the spit, and rising from among low
bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white
in colour. It occurred to me that this might be the white
rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken, and that some day or
other a boat might be wanted, and I should know where to
look for one.</p>

<p>Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained
the rear, or shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon
warmly welcomed by the faithful party.</p>

<p>I had soon told my story, and began to look about me.
The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine&mdash;roof,
walls, and floor. The latter stood in several places
as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface
of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under
this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin
of a rather odd kind&mdash;no other than a great ship&rsquo;s kettle
of iron, with the bottom knocked out, and sunk &ldquo;to her
bearings,&rdquo; as the captain said, among the sand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>Little had been left beside the framework of the house;
but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way
of hearth, and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire.</p>

<p>The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade
had been cleared of timber to build the house, and we
could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had
been destroyed. Most of the soil had been washed away
or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only where
the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss
and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green
among the sand. Very close around the stockade&mdash;too
close for defence, they said&mdash;the wood still flourished high
and dense, all of fir on the land side, but towards the sea
with a large admixture of live-oaks.</p>

<p>The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken,
whistled through every chink of the rude building, and
sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand. There
was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our suppers,
sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for
all the world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney
was a square hole in the roof; it was but a little part of
the smoke that found its way out, and the rest eddied
about the house, and kept us coughing and piping the
eye.</p>

<p>Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied
up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from
the mutineers; and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied,
lay along the wall, stiff and stark under the Union
Jack.</p>

<p>If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have
fallen in the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man
for that. All hands were called up before him, and he
divided us into watches. The doctor, and Gray, and I, for
one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired
as we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more
were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named
cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and lending
a hand wherever it was wanted.</p>

<p>From time to time the doctor came to the door for a
little air and to rest his eyes, which were almost smoked
out of his head; and whenever he did so, he had a word
for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man Smollett,&rdquo; he said once, &ldquo;is a better man
than I am. And when I say that it means a deal, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another time he came and was silent for a while. Then
he put his head on one side, and looked at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Ben Gunn a man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am not very sure
whether he&rsquo;s sane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any doubt about the matter, he is,&rdquo; returned
the doctor. &ldquo;A man who has been three years biting his
nails on a desert island, Jim, can&rsquo;t expect to appear as sane
as you or me. It doesn&rsquo;t lie in human nature. Was it
cheese you said he had a fancy for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, cheese,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;just see the good that comes
of being dainty in your food. You&rsquo;ve seen my snuff-box,
haven&rsquo;t you? And you never saw me take snuff; the
reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan
cheese&mdash;a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious.
Well, that&rsquo;s for Ben Gunn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand,
and stood round him for a while bareheaded in the breeze.
A good deal of firewood had been got in, but not enough
for the captain&rsquo;s fancy; and he shook his head over it, and
told us we &ldquo;must get back to this to-morrow rather livelier.&rdquo;
Then, when we had eaten our pork, and each had a good
stiff glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in
a corner to discuss our prospects.</p>

<p>It appears they were at their wits&rsquo; end what to do, the
stores being so low that we must have been starved into
surrender long before help came. But our best hope, it
was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until they either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
hauled down their flag or ran away with the <i>Hispaniola</i>.
From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two
others were wounded, and one, at least&mdash;the man shot
beside the gun&mdash;severely wounded, if he were not dead.
Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it,
saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And,
besides that, we had two able allies&mdash;rum and the climate.</p>

<p>As for the first, though we were about half a mile away,
we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night;
and as for the second, the doctor staked his wig that, camped
where they were in the marsh, and unprovided with
remedies, the half of them would be on their backs before
a week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if we are not all shot down first
they&rsquo;ll be glad to be packing in the schooner. It&rsquo;s always
a ship, and they can get to buccaneering again, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First ship that ever I lost,&rdquo; said Captain Smollett.</p>

<p>I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to
sleep, which was not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept
like a log of wood.</p>

<p>The rest had long been up, and had already breakfasted
and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much
again, when I was awakened by a bustle and the sound of
voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flag of truce!&rdquo; I heard some one say; and then,
immediately after, with a cry of surprise, &ldquo;Silver himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at that up I jumped, and, rubbing my eyes, ran
to a loophole in the wall.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h5>SILVER&rsquo;S EMBASSY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Sure</span> enough, there were two men just outside the stockade,
one of them waving a white cloth; the other, no less a
person than Silver himself, standing placidly by.</p>

<p>It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that
I think I ever was abroad in; a chill that pierced into the
marrow. The sky was bright and cloudless overhead,
and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun. But where
Silver stood with his lieutenant all was still in shadow, and
they waded knee-deep in a low, white vapour, that had
crawled during the night out of the morass. The chill and
the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island.
It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep indoors, men,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Ten to one
this is a trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he hailed the buccaneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes? Stand, or we fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flag of truce,&rdquo; cried Silver.</p>

<p>The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully
out of the way of a treacherous shot should any be
intended. He turned and spoke to us:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor&rsquo;s watch on the look-out. Dr. Livesey take
the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west.
The watch below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men,
and careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he turned again to the mutineers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you want with your flag of truce?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>This time it was the other man who replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,&rdquo;
he shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Silver! Don&rsquo;t know him. Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; cried
the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself:
&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n, is it? My heart, and here&rsquo;s promotion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long John answered for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap&rsquo;n, after
your desertion, sir&rdquo;&mdash;laying a particular emphasis upon
the word &ldquo;desertion.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re willing to submit, if we
can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is
your word, Cap&rsquo;n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out
of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o&rsquo; shot
before a gun is fired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My man,&rdquo; said Captain Smollett, &ldquo;I have not the
slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me,
you can come, that&rsquo;s all. If there&rsquo;s any treachery, it&rsquo;ll
be on your side, and the Lord help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; shouted Long John cheerily.
&ldquo;A word from you&rsquo;s enough. I know a gentleman, and
you may lay to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting
to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful,
seeing how cavalier had been the captain&rsquo;s answer. But
Silver laughed at him aloud, and slapped him on the back,
as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced
to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and
with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the
fence and dropping safely to the other side.</p>

<p>I will confess that I was far too much taken up with
what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry;
indeed, I had already deserted my eastern loophole, and
crept up behind the captain, who had now seated himself
on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in
his hands, and his eyes fixed on the water, as it bubbled
out of the old iron kettle in the sand. He was whistling
to himself, &ldquo;Come, Lasses and Lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
What with the steepness of the incline, the thick tree-stumps,
and the soft sand, he and his crutch were as helpless
as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it like a man in
silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom he
saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in
his best; an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons,
hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set
on the back of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are, my man,&rdquo; said the captain, raising his
head. &ldquo;You had better sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a-going to let me inside, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo; complained
Long John. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a main cold morning, to be sure, sir,
to sit outside upon the sand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Silver,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;if you had pleased
to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your
galley. It&rsquo;s your own doing. You&rsquo;re either my ship&rsquo;s
cook&mdash;and then you were treated handsome&mdash;or Cap&rsquo;n
Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can
go hang!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; returned the sea cook, sitting down
as he was bidden on the sand, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to give me a
hand up again, that&rsquo;s all. A sweet pretty place you have
of it here.&mdash;Ah, there&rsquo;s Jim! The top of the morning to
you, Jim.&mdash;Doctor, here&rsquo;s my service. Why, there you
all are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,&rdquo;
said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you were, Cap&rsquo;n Smollett,&rdquo; replied Silver.
&ldquo;Dooty is dooty, to be sure. Well, now, you look here,
that was a good lay of yours last night. I don&rsquo;t deny it
was a good lay. Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end.
And I&rsquo;ll not deny neither but what some of
my people was shook&mdash;maybe all was shook; maybe I was
shook myself; maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here for terms. But
you mark me, cap&rsquo;n, it won&rsquo;t do twice, by thunder! We&rsquo;ll
have to do sentry-go, and ease off a point or so on the rum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind&rsquo;s eye.
But I&rsquo;ll tell you I was sober; I was on&rsquo;y dog-tired; and if
I&rsquo;d awoke a second sooner I&rsquo;d a-caught you at the act, I
would. He wasn&rsquo;t dead when I got round to him, not
he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; says Captain Smollett, as cool as can be.</p>

<p>All that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would
never have guessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to
have an inkling. Ben Gunn&rsquo;s last words came back to my
mind. I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers
a visit, while they all lay drunk together round their fire,
and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen
enemies to deal with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here it is,&rdquo; said Silver. &ldquo;We want that treasure
and we&rsquo;ll have it&mdash;that&rsquo;s our point! You would just as
soon save your lives, I reckon; and that&rsquo;s yours. You have
a chart, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; replied the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you have, I know that,&rdquo; returned Long John.
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be so husky with a man; there ain&rsquo;t a particle
of service in that, and you may lay to it. What I mean is,
we want your chart. Now, I never meant you no harm,
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do with me, my man,&rdquo; interrupted the
captain. &ldquo;We know exactly what you meant to do, and
we don&rsquo;t care; for now, you see, you can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the captain looked at him calmly, and proceeded
to fill a pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Abe Gray&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Silver broke out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast there!&rdquo; cried Mr. Smollett. &ldquo;Gray told me
nothing, and I asked him nothing; and what&rsquo;s more, I
would see you and him and this whole island blown clean
out of the water into blazes first. So there&rsquo;s my mind for
you, my man, on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down.
He had been growing nettled before, but now he pulled
himself together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I would set no limits to
what gentlemen might consider ship-shape, or might not,
as the case were. And, seein&rsquo; as how you are about to
take a pipe, cap&rsquo;n, I&rsquo;ll make so free as do likewise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men
sat silently smoking for quite a while, now looking each
other in the face, now stopping their tobacco, now leaning
forward to spit. It was as good as the play to see them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; resumed Silver, &ldquo;here it is. You give us the
chart to get the treasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen,
and stoving of their heads in while asleep. You do
that, and we&rsquo;ll offer you a choice. Either you come aboard
along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I&rsquo;ll give
you my affy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you
somewhere safe ashore. Or, if that ain&rsquo;t to your fancy,
some of my hands being rough, and having old scores, on
account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We&rsquo;ll
divide stores with you, man for man; and I&rsquo;ll give my affy-davy,
as before, to speak the first ship I sight, and send &rsquo;em
here to pick you up. Now you&rsquo;ll own that&rsquo;s talking.
Handsomer you couldn&rsquo;t look to get, not you. And I
hope&rdquo;&mdash;raising his voice&mdash;&ldquo;that all hands in this here
block-house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to
one is spoke to all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Smollett rose from his seat, and knocked out
the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every last word, by thunder!&rdquo; answered John.
&ldquo;Refuse that, and you&rsquo;ve seen the last of me but musket-balls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll hear
me. If you&rsquo;ll come up one by one, unarmed, I&rsquo;ll engage
to clap you all in irons, and take you home to a fair trial
in England. If you won&rsquo;t, my name is Alexander Smollett,
I&rsquo;ve flown my sovereign&rsquo;s colours, and I&rsquo;ll see you all to
Davy Jones. You can&rsquo;t find the treasure. You can&rsquo;t sail
the ship&mdash;there&rsquo;s not a man among you fit to sail the ship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
You can&rsquo;t fight us&mdash;Gray, there, got away from five of you.
Your ship&rsquo;s in irons, Master Silver; you&rsquo;re on a lee shore,
and so you&rsquo;ll find. I stand here and tell you so; and they&rsquo;re
the last good words you&rsquo;ll get from me; for, in the name
of heaven, I&rsquo;ll put a bullet in your back when next I meet
you. Tramp, my lad. Bundle out of this, please, hand
over hand, and double quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver&rsquo;s face was a picture; his eyes started in his head
with wrath. He shook the fire out of his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a hand up!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; returned the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll give me a hand up?&rdquo; he roared.</p>

<p>Not a man among us moved. Growling the foulest
imprecations, he crawled along the sand till he got hold of
the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch.
Then he spat into the spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I think of ye. Before
an hour&rsquo;s out, I&rsquo;ll stove in your old block-house like a rum-puncheon.
Laugh, by thunder, laugh! Before an hour&rsquo;s
out, ye&rsquo;ll laugh upon the other side. Them that die&rsquo;ll
be the lucky ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed
down the sand, was helped across the stockade, after four
or five failures, by the man with the flag of truce, and disappeared
in an instant afterwards among the trees.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h5>THE ATTACK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been
closely watching him, turned towards the interior of the
house, and found not a man of us at his post but Gray. It
was the first time we had ever seen him angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quarters!&rdquo; he roared. And then, as we all slunk
back to our places, &ldquo;Gray,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put your name
in the log; you&rsquo;ve stood by your duty like a seaman.&mdash;Mr.
Trelawney, I&rsquo;m surprised at you, sir.&mdash;Doctor, I
thought you had worn the king&rsquo;s coat! If that was how
you served at Fontenoy, sir, you&rsquo;d have been better in
your berth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s watch were all back at their loopholes,
the rest were busy loading the spare muskets, and every
one with a red face, you may be certain, and a flea in his
ear, as the saying is.</p>

<p>The captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lads,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given Silver a broadside. I
pitched it in red-hot on purpose; and before the hour&rsquo;s
out, as he said, we shall be boarded. We&rsquo;re outnumbered,
I needn&rsquo;t tell you that, but we fight in shelter; and, a
minute ago, I should have said we fought with discipline.
I&rsquo;ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you
choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went the rounds, and saw, as he said, that all
was clear.</p>

<p>On the two short sides of the house, east and west,
there were only two loopholes; on the south side, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the porch was, two again; and on the north side, five.
There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us;
the firewood had been built into four piles&mdash;tables, you
might say&mdash;one about the middle of each side, and on each
of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets
were laid ready to the hand of the defenders. In the middle,
the cutlasses lay ranged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toss out the fire,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;the chill is
past, and we mustn&rsquo;t have smoke in our eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr.
Trelawney, and the embers smothered among sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawkins hasn&rsquo;t had his breakfast.&mdash;Hawkins, help
yourself, and back to your post to eat it,&rdquo; continued Captain
Smollett. &ldquo;Lively, now, my lad; you&rsquo;ll want it before
you&rsquo;ve done.&mdash;Hunter, serve out a round of brandy to all
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while this was going on, the captain completed, in
his own mind, the plan of the defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, you will take the door,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;See
and don&rsquo;t expose yourself; keep within, and fire through
the porch.&mdash;Hunter, take the east side, there.&mdash;Joyce, you
stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you are the
best shot&mdash;you and Gray will take this long north side,
with the five loopholes; it&rsquo;s there the danger is. If they
can get up to it, and fire in upon us through our own ports,
things would begin to look dirty.&mdash;Hawkins, neither you
nor I are much account at the shooting; we&rsquo;ll stand by to
load and bear a hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon
as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with
all its force upon the clearing, and drank up the vapours
at a draught. Soon the sand was baking, and the resin
melting in the logs of the block-house. Jackets and coats
were flung aside; shirts thrown open at the neck, and
rolled up to the shoulders; and we stood there, each at
his post, in a fever of heat and anxiety.</p>

<p>An hour passed away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang them!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;This is as dull as
the doldrums.&mdash;Gray, whistle for a wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just at that moment came the first news of the
attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said Joyce, &ldquo;if I see any one am
I to fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; returned Joyce, with the same quiet
civility.</p>

<p>Nothing followed for a time; but the remark had set
us all on the alert, straining ears and eyes&mdash;the musketeers
with their pieces balanced in their hands, the captain out
in the middle of the block-house, with his mouth very tight
and a frown on his face.</p>

<p>So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped
up his musket and fired. The report had scarcely died
away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a
scattering volley, shot behind shot, like a string of geese,
from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets struck
the log-house, but not one entered; and, as the smoke
cleared away and vanished, the stockade and the woods
around it looked as quiet and empty as before. Not a
bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed
the presence of our foes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hit your man?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Joyce. &ldquo;I believe not, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next best thing to tell the truth,&rdquo; muttered Captain
Smollett. &ldquo;Load his gun, Hawkins. How many should
you say there were on your side, doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know precisely,&rdquo; said Dr. Livesey. &ldquo;Three shots
were fired on this side. I saw the three flashes&mdash;two close
together&mdash;one farther to the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three!&rdquo; repeated the captain. &ldquo;And how many on
yours, Mr. Trelawney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this was not so easily answered. There had come
many from the north&mdash;seven, by the squire&rsquo;s computation;
eight or nine, according to Gray. From the east and west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore,
that the attack would be developed from the north, and
that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed
by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no
change in his arrangement. If the mutineers succeeded
in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession
of any unprotected loophole, and shoot us down
like rats in our own stronghold.</p>

<p>Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly,
with a loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the
woods on the north side, and ran straight on the stockade.
At the same moment the fire was once more opened from
the woods, and a rifle-ball sang through the doorway, and
knocked the doctor&rsquo;s musket into bits.</p>

<p>The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys,
Squire and Gray fired again, and yet again; three men
fell, one forwards into the enclosure, two back on the outside.
But of these, one was evidently more frightened
than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack, and instantly
disappeared among the trees.</p>

<p>Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good
their footing inside our defences; while from the shelter
of the woods seven or eight men, each evidently supplied
with several muskets, kept up a hot, though useless, fire
on the log-house.</p>

<p>The four who had boarded made straight before them
for the building, shouting as they ran, and the men among
the trees shouted back to encourage them. Several shots
were fired; but, such was the hurry of the marksmen, that
not one appeared to have taken effect. In a moment, the
four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon
us.</p>

<p>The head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared
at the middle loophole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At &rsquo;em, all hands&mdash;all hands!&rdquo; he roared, in a voice
of thunder.</p>

<p>At the same moment another pirate grasped Hunter&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
musket by the muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked
it through the loophole, and, with one stunning blow, laid
the poor fellow senseless on the floor. Meanwhile a third,
running unharmed all round the house, appeared suddenly
in the doorway, and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.</p>

<p>Our position was utterly reversed. A moment since
we were firing, under cover, at an exposed enemy; now
it was we who lay uncovered, and could not return a
blow.</p>

<p>The log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our
comparative safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and
reports of pistol-shots, and one loud groan, rang in my
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out, lads, out, and fight &rsquo;em in the open! Cutlasses!&rdquo;
cried the captain.</p>

<p>I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and some one, at the
same time snatching another, gave me a cut across the
knuckles which I hardly felt. I dashed out of the door
into the clear sunlight. Some one was close behind, I
knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing
his assailant down the hill, and, just as my eyes fell upon
him, beat down his guard, and sent him sprawling on his
back, with a great slash across the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Round the house, lads! round the house!&rdquo; cried the
captain; and even in the hurly-burly I perceived a change
in his voice.</p>

<p>Mechanically I obeyed, turned eastwards, and, with
my cutlass raised, ran round the corner of the house. Next
moment I was face to face with Anderson. He roared
aloud, and his hanger went up above his head, flashing in
the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but, as the blow
still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and
missing my foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the
slope.</p>

<p>When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers
had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end
of us. One man, in a red night-cap, with his cutlass in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
his mouth, had even got upon the top and thrown a leg
across. Well, so short had been the interval, that when I
found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow
with the red night-cap still half-way over, another still just
showing his head above the top of the stockade. And yet,
in this breath of time, the fight was over, and the victory
was ours.</p>

<p>Gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big
boatswain ere he had time to recover from his lost blow.
Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of
firing into the house, and now lay in agony, the pistol still
smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor
disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the
palisade, one only remained unaccounted for, and he,
having left his cutlass on the field, was now clambering out
again with the fear of death upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire&mdash;fire from the house!&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;And
you, lads, back into cover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and
the last boarder made good his escape, and disappeared
with the rest into the wood. In three seconds nothing remained
of the attacking party but the five who had fallen,
four on the inside, and one on the outside, of the palisade.</p>

<p>The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter.
The survivors would soon be back where they had left their
muskets, and at any moment the fire might recommence.</p>

<p>The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke,
and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory.
Hunter lay beside his loophole, stunned; Joyce by his,
shot through the head, never to move again; while right
in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain, one
as pale as the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain&rsquo;s wounded,&rdquo; said Mr. Trelawney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they run?&rdquo; asked Mr. Smollett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that could, you may be bound,&rdquo; returned the
doctor; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s five of them will never run
again.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Five!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s better.
Five against three leaves us four to nine. That&rsquo;s better
odds than we had at starting. We were seven to nineteen
then, or thought we were, and that&rsquo;s as bad to bear.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">[1]</span></a></p>

<hr class="foot" />
<div class="note">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" href="#FnAnchor_1">[1]</a> The mutineers were soon only eight in number, for the man shot
by Mr. Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of
his wound. But this was, of course, not known till after by the faithful
party.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<h5>HOW I BEGAN MY SEA ADVENTURE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">There</span> was no return of the mutineers&mdash;not so much as
another shot out of the woods. They had &ldquo;got their
rations for that day,&rdquo; as the captain put it, and we had
the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the
wounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside
in spite of the danger, and even outside we could hardly
tell what we were at, for horror of the loud groans that
reached us from the doctor&rsquo;s patients.</p>

<p>Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only
three still breathed&mdash;that one of the pirates who had been
shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and
of these the first two were as good as dead; the mutineer,
indeed, died under the doctor&rsquo;s knife, and Hunter, do what
we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He
lingered all day, breathing loudly, like the old buccaneer
at home in his apoplectic fit; but the bones of his chest had
been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling,
and some time in the following night, without sign or sound,
he went to his Maker.</p>

<p>As for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed,
but not dangerous. No organ was fatally injured. Anderson&rsquo;s
ball&mdash;for it was Job that shot him first&mdash;had broken
his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not badly; the
second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the
calf. He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the
meantime, and for weeks to come, he must not walk nor
move his arm, nor so much as speak when he could help
it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite.
Dr. Livesey patched it up with plaster, and pulled
my ears for me into the bargain.</p>

<p>After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the
captain&rsquo;s side a while in consultation; and when they had
talked to their hearts&rsquo; content, it being then a little past
noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols, girt on a cutlass,
put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over
his shoulder, crossed the palisade on the north side, and
set off briskly through the trees.</p>

<p>Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the
block-house, to be out of earshot of our officers consulting;
and Gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot
to put it back again, so thunderstruck he was at this
Occurrence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, in the name of Davy Jones,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Dr.
Livesey mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s about the last of this crew
for that, I take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, shipmate,&rdquo; said Gray, &ldquo;mad he may not be;
but if <i>he&rsquo;s</i> not, you mark my words, <i>I</i> am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;the doctor has his idea; and if
I am right, he&rsquo;s going now to see Ben Gunn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was right, as appeared later; but, in the meantime,
the house being stifling hot, and the little patch of sand
inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun, I began to get
another thought into my head, which was not by any means
so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor,
walking in the cool shadow of the woods, with the birds
about him, and the pleasant smell of the pines, while I sat
grilling, with my clothes stuck to the hot resin, and so much
blood about me, and so many poor dead bodies lying all
around, that I took a disgust of the place that was almost
as strong as fear.</p>

<p>All the time I was washing out the block-house and
then washing up the things from dinner, this disgust and
envy kept growing stronger and stronger, till at last, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
near a bread-bag, and no one then observing me, I took the
first step towards my escapade, and filled both pockets of
my coat with biscuit.</p>

<p>I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to
do a foolish, over-bold act; but I was determined to do it
with all the precautions in my power. These biscuits,
should anything befall me, would keep me, at least, from
starving till far on in the next day.</p>

<p>The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols,
and as I already had a powder-horn and bullets, I felt
myself well supplied with arms.</p>

<p>As for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad
one in itself. I was to go down the sandy spit that divides
the anchorage on the east from the open sea, find the white
rock I had observed last evening, and ascertain whether
it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat; a
thing quite worth doing, as I still believe. But as I was
certain I should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my
only plan was to take French leave, and slip out when nobody
was watching; and that was so bad a way of doing
it as made the thing itself wrong. But I was only a boy,
and I had made my mind up.</p>

<p>Well, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable
opportunity. The squire and Gray were busy helping the
captain with his bandages; the coast was clear; I made
a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the
trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of cry
of my companions.</p>

<p>This was my second folly, far worse than the first, as
I left but two sound men to guard the house; but like the
first, it was a help towards saving all of us.</p>

<p>I took my way straight for the east coast of the island,
for I was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to
avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage. It
was already late in the afternoon, although still warm and
sunny. As I continued to thread the tall woods I could
hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
of the surf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of
boughs, which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher
than usual. Soon cool draughts of air began to reach me;
and a few steps farther I came forth into the open borders
of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the
horizon, and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along
the beach.</p>

<p>I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island.
The sun might blaze overhead, the air be without a breath,
the surface smooth and blue, but still these great rollers
would be running along all the external coast, thundering
and thundering by day and night; and I scarce believe
there is one spot in the island where a man would be out
of earshot of their noise.</p>

<p>I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment,
till, thinking I was now got far enough to the south, I took
the cover of some thick bushes, and crept warily up to the
ridge of the spit.</p>

<p>Behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The
sea breeze, as though it had the sooner blown itself out by
its unusual violence, was already at an end; it had been
succeeded by light, variable airs from the south and south-east,
carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under
lee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we
entered it. The <i>Hispaniola</i>, in that unbroken mirror, was
exactly portrayed from the truck to the water-line, the
Jolly Roger hanging from her peak.</p>

<p>Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets&mdash;him
I could always recognise&mdash;while a couple of men
were leaning over the stern bulwarks, one of them with a
red cap&mdash;the very rogue that I had seen some hours before
stride-legs upon the palisade. Apparently they were talking
and laughing, though at that distance&mdash;upwards of a
mile&mdash;I could, of course, hear no word of what was said.
All at once there began the most horrid, unearthly screaming,
which at first startled me badly, though I had soon
remembered the voice of Captain Flint, and even thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
I could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat
perched upon her master&rsquo;s wrist.</p>

<p>Soon after the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore,
and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below
by the cabin companion.</p>

<p>Just about the same time the sun had gone down behind
the Spy-glass, and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began
to grow dark in earnest. I saw I must lose no time if I were
to find the boat that evening.</p>

<p>The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was
still some eighth of a mile farther down the spit, and it
took me a goodish while to get up with it, crawling, often
on all-fours, among the scrub. Night had almost come
when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it
there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden
by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep, that
grew there very plentifully; and in the centre of the dell,
sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what the gipsies
carry about with them in England.</p>

<p>I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent,
and there was Ben Gunn&rsquo;s boat&mdash;home-made if ever anything
was home-made: a rude, lop-sided framework of
tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of goat-skin,
with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small,
even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have
floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set
as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a
double paddle for propulsion.</p>

<p>I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons
made, but I have seen one since, and I can give you no
fairer idea of Ben Gunn&rsquo;s boat than by saying it was like
the first and the worst coracle ever made by man. But the
great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for
it was exceedingly light and portable.</p>

<p>Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have
thought I had had enough of truantry for once; but, in
the meantime, I had taken another notion, and become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
so obstinately fond of it, that I would have carried it out,
I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This
was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the <i>Hispaniola</i>
adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied. I had
quite made up my mind that the mutineers, after their
repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their hearts
than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it
would be a good thing to prevent; and now that I had seen
how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat, I
thought it might be done with little risk.</p>

<p>Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty
meal of biscuit. It was a night out of ten thousand for
my purpose. The fog had now buried all heaven. As
the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared, absolute
blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when,
at last, I shouldered the coracle, and groped my way
stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped, there
were but two points visible on the whole anchorage.</p>

<p>One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated
pirates lay carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere
blur of light upon the darkness, indicated the position of
the anchored ship. She had swung round to the ebb&mdash;her
bow was now towards me&mdash;the only lights on board
were in the cabin; and what I saw was merely a reflection
on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern
window.</p>

<p>The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade
through a long belt of swampy sand, where I sank several
times above the ankle, before I came to the edge of the
retreating water, and wading a little way in, with some
strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on
the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<h5>THE EBB-TIDE RUNS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> coracle&mdash;as I had ample reason to know before I was
done with her&mdash;was a very safe boat for a person of my
height and weight, both buoyant and clever in a sea-way;
but she was the most cross-grained, lop-sided craft to
manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more leeway
than anything else, and turning round and round was
the man&oelig;uvre she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself
has admitted that she was &ldquo;queer to handle till you knew
her way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every
direction but the one I was bound to go; the most part of
the time we were broadside on, and I am very sure I never
should have made the ship at all but for the tide. By good
fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping me
down; and there lay the <i>Hispaniola</i> right in the fair-way,
hardly to be missed.</p>

<p>First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet
blacker than darkness, then her spars and hull began to
take shape, and the next moment, as it seemed (for, the
farther I went the brisker grew the current of the ebb),
I was alongside of her hawser, and had laid hold.</p>

<p>The hawser was as taut as a bowstring&mdash;so strong she
pulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness,
the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little
mountain stream. One cut with my sea-gully, and the
<i>Hispaniola</i> would go humming down the tide.</p>

<p>So far so good; but it next occurred to my recollection
that a taut hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
as a kicking horse. Ten to one, if I were so foolhardy as
to cut the <i>Hispaniola</i> from her anchor, I and the coracle
would be knocked clean out of the water.</p>

<p>This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not
again particularly favoured me, I should have had to
abandon my design. But the light airs which had begun
blowing from the south-east and south had hauled round
after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was
meditating, a puff came, caught the <i>Hispaniola</i>, and forced
her up into the current; and to my great joy, I felt the
hawser slacken in my grasp, and the hand by which I held
it dip for a second under water.</p>

<p>With that I made my mind up, took out my gully,
opened it with my teeth, and cut one strand after another,
till the vessel only swung by two. Then I lay quiet, waiting
to sever these last when the strain should be once more
lightened by a breath of wind.</p>

<p>All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from
the cabin; but, to say truth, my mind had been so entirely
taken up with other thoughts that I had scarcely given
ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began
to pay more heed.</p>

<p>One I recognised for the coxswain&rsquo;s, Israel Hands,
that had been Flint&rsquo;s gunner in former days. The other
was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men
were plainly the worse for drink, and they were still drinking;
for, even while I was listening, one of them, with a
drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something,
which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they
were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously
angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then
there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure
to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off,
and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next
crisis came, and, in its turn, passed away without result.</p>

<p>On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire
burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor&rsquo;s song, with a droop
and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no
end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had heard
it on the voyage more than once, and remembered these
words:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p class="ind03">&ldquo;But one man of her crew alive,</p>
<p>What put to sea with seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate
for a company that had met such cruel losses in the
morning. But, indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers
were as callous as the sea they sailed on.</p>

<p>At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew
nearer in the dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more,
and with a good, tough effort, cut the last fibres through.</p>

<p>The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and
I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the
<i>Hispaniola</i>. At the same time the schooner began to
turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end, across
the current.</p>

<p>I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to
be swamped; and since I found I could not push the coracle
directly off, I now shoved straight astern. At length I was
clear of my dangerous neighbour; and just as I gave the
last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord that
was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly
I grasped it.</p>

<p>Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was
at first mere instinct; but once I had it in my hands and
found it fast, curiosity began to get the upper hand, and I
determined I should have one look through the cabin
window.</p>

<p>I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and, when I
judged myself near enough, rose at infinite risk to about
half my height, and thus commanded the roof and a slice
of the interior of the cabin.</p>

<p>By this time the schooner and her little consort were
gliding pretty swiftly through the water; indeed, we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
already fetched up level with the camp-fire. The ship was
talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading the innumerable
ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I got
my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why
the watchmen had taken no alarm. One glance, however,
was sufficient; and it was only one glance that I durst take
from that unsteady skiff. It showed me Hands and his
companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a
hand upon the other&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for
I was near overboard. I could see nothing for the moment
but these two furious, encrimsoned faces, swaying together
under the smoky lamp; and I shut my eyes to let them
grow once more familiar with the darkness.</p>

<p>The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the
whole diminished company about the camp-fire had broken
into the chorus I had heard so often:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p class="ind03">&ldquo;Fifteen men on the dead man&rsquo;s chest&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!</p>
<p>Drink and the devil had done for the rest&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were
at that very moment in the cabin of the <i>Hispaniola</i>, when
I was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle. At the
same moment she yawed sharply and seemed to change
her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely
increased.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little
ripples, combing over with a sharp, bristling sound, and
slightly phosphorescent. The <i>Hispaniola</i> herself, a few
yards in whose wake I was still being whirled along, seemed
to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a little
against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer,
I made sure she also was wheeling to the southward.</p>

<p>I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped
against my ribs. There, right behind me, was the glow
of the camp-fire. The current had turned at right angles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little
dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher,
ever muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows
for the open sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent
yaw, turning perhaps through twenty degrees; and almost
at the same moment one shout followed another from on
board; I could hear feet pounding on the companion-ladder;
and I knew that the two drunkards had at last
been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense
of their disaster.</p>

<p>I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff,
and devoutly recommended my spirit to its Maker. At
the end of the straits I made sure we must fall into some
bar of raging breakers, where all my troubles would be
ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to die,
I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.</p>

<p>So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to
and fro upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying
sprays, and never ceasing to expect death at the next
plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a numbness,
an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst
of my terrors; until sleep at last supervened, and in my
sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home and the old
&ldquo;Admiral Benbow.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<h5>THE CRUISE OF THE CORACLE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">It</span> was broad day when I awoke, and found myself tossing
at the south-west end of Treasure Island. The sun was
up, but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the
Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to the sea
in formidable cliffs.</p>

<p>Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my
elbow; the hill bare and dark, the head bound with cliffs
forty or fifty feet high, and fringed with great masses of
fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward,
and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.</p>

<p>That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen
rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations,
heavy sprays flying and falling, succeeded one another
from second to second; and I saw myself, if I ventured
nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore, or spending
my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.</p>

<p>Nor was that all; for crawling together on flat tables
of rock, or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud
reports, I beheld huge slimy monsters&mdash;soft snails, as it
were, of incredible bigness&mdash;two or three score of them
together, making the rocks to echo with their barkings.</p>

<p>I have understood since that they were sea-lions, and
entirely harmless. But the look of them, added to the
difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf, was
more than enough to disgust me of that landing place. I
felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such
perils.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed,
before me. North of Haulbowline Head, the land runs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
a long way, leaving, at low tide, a long stretch of yellow
sand. To the north of that, again, there comes another
cape&mdash;Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart&mdash;buried
in tall green pines, which descended to the margin
of the sea.</p>

<p>I remembered what Silver had said about the current
that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure
Island; and seeing from my position that I was already
under its influence, I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head
behind me, and reserve my strength for an attempt to land
upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.</p>

<p>There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The
wind blowing steady and gentle from the south, there was
no contrariety between that and the current, and the billows
rose and fell unbroken.</p>

<p>Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished;
but as it was, it is surprising how easily and securely my
little and light boat could ride. Often, as I still lay at the
bottom, and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale,
I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;
yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on
springs, and subside on the other side into the trough as
lightly as a bird.</p>

<p>I began after a little to grow very bold, and sat up to try
my skill at paddling. But even a small change in the disposition
of the weight will produce violent changes in the
behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly moved before
the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,
ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made
me giddy, and struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep
into the side of the next wave.</p>

<p>I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back
into my old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to
find her head again, and led me as softly as before among
the billows. It was plain she was not to be interfered with,
and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her course,
what hope had I left of reaching land?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head
for all that. First, moving with all care, I gradually baled
out the coracle with my sea-cap; then getting my eye once
more above the gunwale, I set myself to study how it was
she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.</p>

<p>I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy
mountain it looks from the shore, or from a vessel&rsquo;s deck,
was for all the world like any range of hills on the dry land,
full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The coracle,
left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to
speak, her way through these lower parts, and avoided
the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the
wave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; thought I to myself, &ldquo;it is plain I must
lie where I am, and not disturb the balance; but it is plain,
also, that I can put the paddle over the side, and from time
to time, in smooth places, give her a shove or two towards
land.&rdquo; No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay
on my elbows, in the most trying attitude, and every now
and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to
shore.</p>

<p>It was very tiring, and slow work, yet I did visibly
gain ground; and, as we drew near the Cape of the Woods,
though I saw I must infallibly miss that point, I had still
made some hundred yards of easting. I was, indeed, close
in. I could see the cool, green tree-tops swaying together
in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory
without fail.</p>

<p>It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with
thirst. The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold
reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried
upon me, caking my very lips with salt, combined to make
my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the trees
so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing;
but the current had soon carried me past the point; and,
as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that
changed the nature of my thoughts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the
<i>Hispaniola</i> under sail. I made sure, of course, that I
should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water
that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought;
and, long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had
taken entire possession of my mind, and I could do nothing
but stare and wonder.</p>

<p>The <i>Hispaniola</i> was under her main-sail and two jibs,
and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow
or silver. When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing;
she was lying a course about north-west; and I presumed
the men on board were going round the island on
their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began
to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought
they had sighted me and were going about in chase. At
last, however, she fell right into the wind&rsquo;s eye, was taken
dead aback, and stood there a while helpless, with her sails
shivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clumsy fellows,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they must still be drunk
as owls.&rdquo; And I thought how Captain Smollett would
have set them skipping.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off, and filled
again upon another tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or
so, and brought up once more dead in the wind&rsquo;s eye.
Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and
down, north, south, east, and west, the <i>Hispaniola</i> sailed
by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she
had begun, with idly-flapping canvas. It became plain
to me that nobody was steering. And, if so, where were
the men? Either they were dead drunk, or had deserted
her, I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board, I might
return the vessel to her captain.</p>

<p>The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward
at an equal rate. As for the latter&rsquo;s sailing, it was
so wild and intermittent, and she hung each time so long
in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if she did not
even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
sure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air
of adventure that inspired me, and the thought of the
water-breaker beside the fore-companion doubled my
growing courage.</p>

<p>Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another
cloud of spray, but this time stuck to my purpose; and
set myself, with all my strength and caution, to paddle
after the unsteered <i>Hispaniola</i>. Once I shipped a sea so
heavy that I had to stop and bale, with my heart fluttering
like a bird; but gradually I got into the way of the thing,
and guided my coracle among the waves, with only now
and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my
face.</p>

<p>I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could
see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about; and
still no soul appeared upon her decks. I could not choose
but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men were lying
drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps,
and do what I chose with the ship.</p>

<p>For some time she had been doing the worst thing
possible for me&mdash;standing still. She headed nearly due
south, yawing, of course, all the time. Each time she fell
off her sails partly filled, and these brought her, in a moment,
right to the wind again. I have said this was the worst
thing possible for me; for helpless as she looked in this
situation, with the canvas cracking like cannon, and the
blocks trundling and banging on the deck, she still continued
to run away from me, not only with the speed of the current,
but by the whole amount of her leeway, which was naturally
great.</p>

<p>But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell,
for some seconds, very low, and the current gradually turning
her, the <i>Hispaniola</i> revolved slowly round her centre,
and at last presented me her stern, with the cabin window
still gaping open, and the lamp over the table still burning
on into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner.
She was stock-still, but for the current.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>For the last little while I had even lost; but now redoubling
my efforts, I began once more to overhaul the
chase.</p>

<p>I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind
came again in a clap; she filled on the port tack, and was
off again, stooping and skimming like a swallow.</p>

<p>My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was
towards joy. Round she came, till she was broadside on
to me&mdash;round still till she had covered a half, and then
two-thirds, and then three-quarters of the distance that
separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under
her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my
low station in the coracle.</p>

<p>And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had
scarce time to think&mdash;scarce time to act and save myself.
I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came
stooping over the next. The bowsprit was over my head.
I sprang to my feet, and leaped, stamping the coracle under
water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my
foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I
still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the
schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle,
and that I was left without retreat on the <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<h5>I STRIKE THE JOLLY ROGER</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">I had</span> scarce gained a position on the bowsprit, when the
flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a
report like a gun. The schooner trembled to her keel under
the reverse; but next moment, the other sails still drawing,
the jib flapped back again, and hung idle.</p>

<p>This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now
I lost no time, crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled
head-foremost on the deck.</p>

<p>I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the main-sail,
which was still drawing, concealed from me a certain
portion of the after-deck. Not a soul was to be seen. The
planks, which had not been swabbed since the mutiny, bore
the print of many feet; and an empty bottle, broken by
the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.</p>

<p>Suddenly the <i>Hispaniola</i> came right into the wind.
The jibs behind me cracked aloud; the rudder slammed-to;
the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder,
and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,
the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee
after-deck.</p>

<p>There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap
on his back, as stiff as a handspike, with his arms stretched
out like those of a crucifix, and his teeth showing through
his open lips; Israel Hands propped against the bulwarks,
his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on
the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow-candle.</p>

<p>For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a
vicious horse, the sails filling, now on one tack, now on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
another, and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast
groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again, too,
there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark,
and a heavy blow of the ship&rsquo;s bows against the swell:
so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged
ship than by my home-made, lop-sided coracle, now gone
to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and
fro; but&mdash;what was ghastly to behold&mdash;neither his attitude
nor his fixed teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed
by this rough usage. At every jump, too, Hands appeared
still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the
deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole
body canting towards the stern, so that his face became,
little by little, hid from me; and at last I could see nothing
beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker.</p>

<p>At the same time, I observed, around both of them,
splashes of dark blood upon the planks, and began to feel
sure that they had killed each other in their drunken
wrath.</p>

<p>While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm
moment, when the ship was still, Israel Hands turned
partly round, and, with a low moan, writhed himself back
to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan,
which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in
which his jaw hung open, went right to my heart. But
when I remembered the talk I had overheard from the
apple-barrel, all pity left me.</p>

<p>I walked aft until I reached the main-mast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come aboard, Mr. Hands,&rdquo; I said ironically.</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes round heavily; but he was too far
gone to express surprise. All he could do was to utter one
word, &ldquo;Brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It occurred to me there was no time to lose; and, dodging
the boom as it once more lurched across the deck, I
slipped aft, and down the companion-stairs into the cabin.</p>

<p>It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of
the chart. The floor was thick with mud, where ruffians
had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes
round their camp. The bulk-heads, all painted in clear
white, and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty
hands. Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners
to the rolling of the ship. One of the doctor&rsquo;s medical
books lay open on the table, half of the leaves gutted out,
I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all this the lamp
still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.</p>

<p>I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and
of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk
out and thrown away. Certainly, since the mutiny began,
not a man of them could ever have been sober.</p>

<p>Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy
left, for Hands; and for myself I routed out some biscuit,
some pickled fruits, a great bunch of raisins, and a piece of
cheese. With these I came on deck, put down my own
stock behind the rudder-head, and well out of the coxswain&rsquo;s
reach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had
a good, deep drink of water, and then, and not till then,
gave Hands the brandy.</p>

<p>He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle
from his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by thunder, but I wanted some o&rsquo;
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had sat down already in my own corner and begun
to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much hurt?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>

<p>He grunted, or, rather, I might say, he barked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that doctor was aboard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be right
enough in a couple of turns; but I don&rsquo;t have no manner
of luck, you see, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with me.&mdash;As
for that swab, he&rsquo;s good and dead, he is,&rdquo; he added,
indicating the man with the red cap. &ldquo;He warn&rsquo;t no seaman,
anyhow.&mdash;And where mought you have come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come aboard to take posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>sion
of this ship, Mr. Hands, and you&rsquo;ll please regard me
as your captain until further notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me sourly enough, but said nothing. Some
of the colour had come back into his cheeks, though he still
looked very sick, and still continued to slip out and settle
down as the ship banged about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have these colours,
Mr. Hands; and, by your leave, I&rsquo;ll strike &rsquo;em. Better
none than these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines,
handed down their cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God save the King!&rdquo; said I, waving my cap; &ldquo;and
there&rsquo;s an end to Captain Silver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while
on his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; he said at last&mdash;&ldquo;I reckon, Cap&rsquo;n Hawkins,
you&rsquo;ll kind of want to get ashore, now. S&rsquo;pose we
talks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;with all my heart, Mr. Hands.
Say on.&rdquo; And I went back to my meal with a good
appetite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; he began, nodding feebly at the corpse&mdash;&ldquo;O&rsquo;Brien
were his name&mdash;a rank Irelander&mdash;this man
and me got the canvas on her, meaning for to sail her back.
Well, <i>he&rsquo;s</i> dead now, he is&mdash;as dead as bilge; and who&rsquo;s
to sail this ship I don&rsquo;t see. Without I gives you a hint,
you ain&rsquo;t that man, as far&rsquo;s I can tell. Now, look here,
you gives me food and drink, and a old scarf or ankercher
to tie my wound up, you do; and I&rsquo;ll tell you how to sail
her; and that&rsquo;s about square all round, I take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing,&rdquo; says I: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back
to Captain Kidd&rsquo;s anchorage. I mean to get into North
Inlet, and beach her quietly there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure you did,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, I ain&rsquo;t sich
an infernal lubber, after all. I can see, can&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ve
tried my fling, I have, and I&rsquo;ve lost, and it&rsquo;s you has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I haven&rsquo;t no ch&rsquo;ice, not
I! I&rsquo;d help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder!
so I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this.
We struck our bargain on the spot. In three minutes I
had the <i>Hispaniola</i> sailing easily before the wind along the
coast of Treasure Island, with good hopes of turning the
northern point ere noon, and beating down again as far as
North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her
safely, and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.</p>

<p>Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own
chest, where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother&rsquo;s.
With this, and with my aid, Hands bound up the great
bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after he had
eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy,
he began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder
and clearer, and looked in every way another man.</p>

<p>The breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before
it like a bird, the coast of the island flashing by, and the
view changing every minute. Soon we were past the high
lands and bowling beside low, sandy country, sparsely
dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that
again, and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that
ends the island on the north.</p>

<p>I was greatly elated with my new command, and
pleased with the bright, sunshiny weather and these different
prospects of the coast. I had now plenty of water and
good things to eat, and my conscience, which had smitten
me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest
I had made. I should, I think, have had nothing left me
to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed
me derisively about the deck, and the odd smile that appeared
continually on his face. It was a smile that had in
it something both of pain and weakness&mdash;a haggard, old
man&rsquo;s smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision,
a shadow of treachery, in his expression as he craftily
watched, and watched, and watched me at my work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<h5>ISRAEL HANDS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west.
We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner
of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet. Only, as
we had no power to anchor, and dared not beach her till
the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our
hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to;
after a good many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in
silence, over another meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said he, at length, with that same uncomfortable
smile, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s my old shipmate, O&rsquo;Brien; s&rsquo;pose you was
to heave him overboard. I ain&rsquo;t partic&rsquo;lar as a rule, and
I don&rsquo;t take no blame for settling his hash; but I don&rsquo;t
reckon him ornamental, now, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not strong enough, and I don&rsquo;t like the job; and
there he lies, for me,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here&rsquo;s an unlucky ship&mdash;this <i>Hispaniola</i>, Jim,&rdquo;
he went on, blinking. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a power of men have
been killed in this <i>Hispaniola</i>&mdash;a sight o&rsquo; poor seamen
dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol. I
never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here
O&rsquo;Brien now&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead, ain&rsquo;t he? Well, now, I&rsquo;m no
scholar, and you&rsquo;re a lad as can read and figure; and, to
put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good,
or do he come alive again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit;
you must know that already,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;O&rsquo;Brien there
is in another world, and maybe watching us.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s unfort&rsquo;nate&mdash;appears
as if killing parties was a waste of time. Howsomever,
sperrits don&rsquo;t reckon for much, by what I&rsquo;ve seen. I&rsquo;ll
chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you&rsquo;ve spoke
up free, and I&rsquo;ll take it kind if you&rsquo;d step down into that
there cabin and get me a&mdash;well, a&mdash;shiver my timbers!
I can&rsquo;t hit the name on&rsquo;t; well, you get me a bottle of wine,
Jim&mdash;this here brandy&rsquo;s too strong for my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the coxswain&rsquo;s hesitation seemed to be unnatural;
and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I
entirely disbelieved it. The whole story was a pretext.
He wanted me to leave the deck&mdash;so much was plain; but
with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes
never met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and
down, now with a look to the sky, now with a flitting glance
upon the dead O&rsquo;Brien. All the time he kept smiling, and
putting his tongue out in the most guilty, embarrassed
manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent
on some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however,
for I saw where my advantage lay; and that with a
fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions
to the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some wine?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Far better. Will you have
white or red?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon it&rsquo;s about the blessed same to me,
shipmate,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s strong, and plenty of it,
what&rsquo;s the odds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you port, Mr.
Hands. But I&rsquo;ll have to dig for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that I scuttled down the companion with all the
noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the
sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped
my head out of the fore-companion. I knew he would
not expect to see me there; yet I took every precaution
possible; and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved
too true.</p>

<p>He had risen from his position to his hands and knees;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
and, though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when
he moved&mdash;for I could hear him stifle a groan&mdash;yet it was
at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the
deck. In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers,
and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a
short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked
upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his underjaw, tried
the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it
in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old
place against the bulwark.</p>

<p>This was all that I required to know. Israel could
move about; he was now armed; and if he had been at
so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was
meant to be the victim. What he would do afterwards&mdash;whether
he would try to crawl right across the island from
North Inlet to the camp among the swamps, or whether
he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades
might come first to help him, was, of course, more than I
could say.</p>

<p>Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since
in that our interests jumped together, and that was in the
disposition of the schooner. We both desired to have her
stranded safe enough, in a sheltered place, and so that, when
the time came, she could be got off again with as little labour
and danger as might be; and until that was done I considered
that my life would certainly be spared.</p>

<p>While I was thus turning the business over in my mind,
I had not been idle with my body. I had stolen back to
the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, and laid my
hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now, with this for
an excuse, I made my re-appearance on the deck.</p>

<p>Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a
bundle, and with his eyelids lowered, as though he were
too weak to bear the light. He looked up, however, at
my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle, like a man
who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig,
with his favourite toast of &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo; Then he lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco,
begged me to cut him a quid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut me a junk o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for I haven&rsquo;t no
knife, and hardly strength enough, so be as I had. Ah,
Jim, Jim, I reckon I&rsquo;ve missed stays! Cut me a quid, as&rsquo;ll
likely be the last, lad; for I&rsquo;m for my long home and no
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut you some tobacco; but if
I was you and thought myself so badly, I would go to my
prayers, like a Christian man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now, you tell me why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You were asking me just now
about the dead. You&rsquo;ve broken your trust; you&rsquo;ve lived
in sin and lies and blood; there&rsquo;s a man you killed lying
at your feet this moment; and you ask me why! For
God&rsquo;s mercy, Mr. Hands, that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk
he had hidden in his pocket, and designed, in his ill
thoughts, to end me with. He, for his part, took a great
draught of the wine, and spoke with the most unusual
solemnity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For thirty years,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sailed the seas, and
seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul,
provisions running out, knives going, and what not. Well,
now I tell you, I never seen good come o&rsquo; goodness yet.
Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don&rsquo;t bite;
them&rsquo;s my views&mdash;amen, so be it. And now, you look
here,&rdquo; he added, suddenly changing his tone, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had
about enough of this foolery. The tide&rsquo;s made good
enough by now. You just take my orders, Cap&rsquo;n Hawkins,
and we&rsquo;ll sail slap in and be done with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation
was delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage
was not only narrow and shoal, but lay east and west, so
that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in. I
think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am very sure
that Hands was an excellent pilot; for we went about and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
about, and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty
and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed
around us. The shores of North Inlet were as thickly
wooded as those of the southern anchorage; but the space
was longer and narrower, and more like, what in truth it was,
the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern end
we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation.
It had been a great vessel of three masts, but had lain so
long exposed to the injuries of the weather, that it was hung
about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on the deck
of it shore bushes had taken root, and now flourished thick
with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the
anchorage was calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hands, &ldquo;look there; there&rsquo;s a pet bit for
to beach a ship in. Fine flat sand, never a catspaw, trees
all around of it, and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that
old ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And once beached,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;how shall we get her
off again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so,&rdquo; he replied: &ldquo;you take a line ashore there on
the other side at low water: take a turn about one o&rsquo; them
big pines; bring it back, take a turn around the capstan,
and lie-to for the tide. Come high water, all hands take a
pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet as natur&rsquo;.
And now, boy, you stand by. We&rsquo;re near the bit now, and
she&rsquo;s too much way on her. Starboard a little&mdash;so&mdash;steady&mdash;starboard&mdash;larboard
a little&mdash;steady&mdash;steady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed;
till, all of a sudden, he cried, &ldquo;Now, my hearty, luff!&rdquo;
And I put the helm hard up, and the <i>Hispaniola</i> swung
round rapidly, and ran stem on for the low-wooded
shore.</p>

<p>The excitement of these last man&oelig;uvres had somewhat
interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto, sharply
enough, upon the coxswain. Even then I was still so much
interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I had quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
forgot the peril that hung over my head, and stood craning
over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading
wide before the bows. I might have fallen without a
struggle for my life, had not a sudden disquietude seized
upon me, and made me turn my head. Perhaps I had
heard a creak, or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my
eye; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat&rsquo;s; but, sure
enough, when I looked round, there was Hands, already
half-way towards me, with the dirk in his right hand.</p>

<p>We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met;
but while mine was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of
fury like a charging bull&rsquo;s. At the same instant he threw
himself forward, and I leapt sideways towards the bows.
As I did so, I left hold of the tiller, which sprang sharp to
leeward; and I think this saved my life, for it struck
Hands across the chest, and stopped him, for the moment,
dead.</p>

<p>Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner
where he had me trapped, with all the deck to dodge about.
Just forward of the main-mast I stopped, drew a pistol from
my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had already turned
and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the
trigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash
nor sound; the priming was useless with sea-water. I
cursed myself for my neglect. Why had not I, long before,
reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then I should
not have been, as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this
butcher.</p>

<p>Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could
move, his grizzled hair tumbling over his face, and his face
itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury. I had
no time to try my other pistol, nor, indeed, much inclination,
for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I saw plainly:
I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily
hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so
nearly boxed me in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or
ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>perience
on this side of eternity. I placed my palms against
the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness, and waited,
every nerve upon the stretch.</p>

<p>Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a
moment or two passed in feints on his part, and corresponding
movements upon mine. It was such a game as I had
often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove;
but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly
beating heart as now. Still, as I say, it was a boy&rsquo;s game,
and I thought I could hold my own at it, against an elderly
seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed, my courage had
begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting
thoughts on what would be the end of the affair; and while
I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no
hope of any ultimate escape.</p>

<p>Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the <i>Hispaniola</i>
struck, staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and
then, swift as a blow, canted over to the port side, till the
deck stood at an angle of forty-five degrees, and about a
puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes, and lay,
in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.</p>

<p>We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us
rolled, almost together, into the scuppers; the dead red-cap,
with his arms still spread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So
near were we, indeed, that my head came against the coxswain&rsquo;s
foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle. Blow
and all, I was the first afoot again; for Hands had got involved
with the dead body. The sudden canting of the
ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to
find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for
my foe was almost touching me. Quick as thought I
sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,
and did not draw breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.</p>

<p>I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck
not half a foot below me, as I pursued my upward flight;
and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in
changing the priming of my pistol, and then, having one
ready for service, and to make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded
to draw the load of the other, and recharge it afresh
from the beginning.</p>

<p>My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he
began to see the dice going against him; and after an obvious
hesitation, he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds,
and, with the dirk in his teeth, began slowly and painfully
to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans to haul
his wounded leg behind him; and I had quietly finished my
arrangements before he was much more than a third of the
way up. Then, with a pistol in either hand, I addressed
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One more step, Mr. Hands,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll blow
your brains out! Dead men don&rsquo;t bite, you know,&rdquo; I
added, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of
his face that he was trying to think, and the process was so
slow and laborious that, in my new-found security, I
laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he spoke, his
face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.
In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth,
but, in all else, he remained unmoved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;re fouled, you and me,
and we&rsquo;ll have to sign articles. I&rsquo;d have had you but for
that there lurch: but I don&rsquo;t have no luck, not I; and I
reckon I&rsquo;ll have to strike, which comes hard, you see, for a
master mariner to a ship&rsquo;s younker like you, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited
as a cock upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back
went his right hand over his shoulder. Something sang like
an arrow through the air: I felt a blow and then a sharp
pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast.
In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment&mdash;I scarce can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
say it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without
a conscious aim&mdash;both my pistols went off, and both
escaped out of my hands. They did not fall alone; with a
choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds,
and plunged head first into the water.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<h5>&ldquo;PIECES OF EIGHT&rdquo;</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over
the water, and from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing
below me but the surface of the bay. Hands, who was
not so far up, was, in consequence, near to the ship, and fell
between me and the bulwarks. He rose once to the surface
in a lather of foam and blood, and then sank again for good.
As the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together
on the clean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel&rsquo;s sides.
A fish or two whipped past his body. Sometimes, by the
quivering of the water, he appeared to move a little, as if he
were trying to rise. But he was dead enough, for all that,
being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish in the
very place where he had designed my slaughter.</p>

<p>I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick,
faint, and terrified. The hot blood was running over my
back and chest. The dirk, where it had pinned my shoulder
to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot iron; yet it was not
so much these real sufferings that distressed me, for these,
it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was the
horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees
into that still green water, beside the body of the coxswain.</p>

<p>I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut
my eyes as if to cover up the peril. Gradually my mind
came back again, my pulses quieted down to a more natural
time, and I was once more in possession of myself.</p>

<p>It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk; but
either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me; and I desisted
with a violent shudder. Oddly enough, that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
shudder did the business. The knife, in fact, had come the
nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by
a mere pinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. The
blood ran down the faster, to be sure; but I was my own
master again, and only tacked to the mast by my coat and
shirt.</p>

<p>These last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then
regained the deck by the starboard shrouds. For nothing
in the world would I have again ventured, shaken as I was,
upon the overhanging port shrouds, from which Israel had
so lately fallen.</p>

<p>I went below, and did what I could for my wound; it
pained me a good deal, and still bled freely; but it was
neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it greatly gall me when
I used my arm. Then I looked around me, and as the ship
was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it
from its last passenger&mdash;the dead man, O&rsquo;Brien.</p>

<p>He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks,
where he lay like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet;
life-size, indeed, but how different from life&rsquo;s colour or life&rsquo;s
comeliness! In that position I could easily have my way
with him; and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn
off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him by the waist
as if he had been a sack of bran, and with one good heave
tumbled him overboard. He went in with a sounding
plunge; the red cap came off, and remained floating on the
surface; and as soon as the splash subsided, I could see him
and Israel lying side by side, both wavering with the tremulous
movement of the water. O&rsquo;Brien, though still quite a
young man, was very bald. There he lay, with that bald
head across the knees of the man who had killed him, and
the quick fishes steering to and fro over both.</p>

<p>I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned.
The sun was within so few degrees of setting that already
the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to
reach right across the anchorage, and fall in patterns on the
deck. The evening breeze had sprung up, and though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the
east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself
and the idle sails to rattle to and fro.</p>

<p>I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily
doused and brought tumbling to the deck; but the mainsail
was a harder matter. Of course, when the schooner
canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and the cap of
it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I
thought this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain
was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last I got my
knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly,
a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water;
and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhaul,
that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the
rest, the <i>Hispaniola</i> must trust to luck, like myself.</p>

<p>By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow&mdash;the
last rays, I remember, falling through a glade of the
wood, and shining bright as jewels, on the flowery mantle
of the wreck. It began to be chill; the tide was rapidly
fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more on her
beam-ends.</p>

<p>I scrambled forward and looked over. It seemed
shallow enough, and holding the cut hawser in both hands
for a last security, I let myself drop softly overboard. The
water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was firm and
covered with ripple-marks, and I waded ashore in great
spirits, leaving the <i>Hispaniola</i> on her side, with her mainsail
trailing wide upon the surface of the bay. About the
same time the sun went fairly down, and the breeze whistled
low in the dusk among the tossing pines.</p>

<p>At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned
thence empty-handed. There lay the schooner, clear at
last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board
and get to sea again. I had nothing nearer my fancy than
to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements.
Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the
recapture of the <i>Hispaniola</i> was a clenching answer, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had not
lost my time.</p>

<p>So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my
face homeward for the block-house and my companions.
I remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which
drain into Captain Kidd&rsquo;s anchorage ran from the two-peaked
hill upon my left; and I bent my course in that
direction that I might pass the stream while it was small.
The wood was pretty open, and keeping along the lower
spurs, I had soon turned the corner of that hill, and not long
after waded to the mid-calf across the water-course.</p>

<p>This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben
Gunn, the maroon; and I walked more circumspectly, keeping
an eye on every side. The dusk had come nigh hand completely,
and, as I opened out the cleft between the two peaks,
I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where,
as I judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper
before a roaring fire. And yet I wondered, in my heart,
that he should show himself so careless. For if I could see
this radiance, might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself
where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?</p>

<p>Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to
guide myself even roughly towards my destination; the
double hill behind me and the Spy-glass on my right hand
loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few and pale; and
in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among
bushes and rolling into sandy pits.</p>

<p>Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. I looked
up; a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the
summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after I saw something
broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and
knew the moon had risen.</p>

<p>With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained
to me of my journey; and, sometimes walking,
sometimes running, impatiently drew near to the stockade.
Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before it, I was
not so thoughtless but that I slackened my pace and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
a trifle warily. It would have been a poor end of my adventures
to get shot down by my own party in mistake.</p>

<p>The moon was climbing higher and higher; its light
began to fall here and there in masses through the more
open districts of the wood; and right in front of me a glow
of a different colour appeared among the trees. It was red
and hot, and now and again it was a little darkened&mdash;as it
were the embers of a bonfire smouldering.</p>

<p>For the life of me, I could not think what it might be.</p>

<p>At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing.
The western end was already steeped in moonshine:
the rest, and the block-house itself, still lay in a black
shadow, chequered with long, silvery streaks of light. On
the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself
into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation, contrasted
strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon.
There was not a soul stirring, nor a sound beside the noises
of the breezes.</p>

<p>I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps
a little terror also. It had not been our way to build great
fires; we were, indeed, by the captain&rsquo;s orders, somewhat
niggardly of firewood; and I began to fear that something
had gone wrong while I was absent.</p>

<p>I stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow,
and at a convenient place, where the darkness was thickest,
crossed the palisade.</p>

<p>To make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and
knees, and crawled, without a sound, towards the corner of
the house. As I drew nearer, my heart was suddenly and
greatly lightened. It is not a pleasant noise in itself, and I
have often complained of it at other times; but just then it
was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud
and peaceful in their sleep. The sea-cry of the watch, that
beautiful &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; never fell more reassuringly on my
ear.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing: they
kept an infamous bad watch. If it had been Silver and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
lads that were now creeping in on them, not a soul would
have seen daybreak. That was what it was, thought I, to
have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself
sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to
mount guard.</p>

<p>By this time I had got to the door and stood up. All
was dark within, so that I could distinguish nothing by the
eye. As for sounds, there was the steady drone of the
snorers, and a small occasional noise, a flickering or pecking
that I could in no way account for.</p>

<p>With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should
lie down in my own place (I thought, with a silent chuckle)
and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning.</p>

<p>My foot struck something yielding&mdash;it was a sleeper&rsquo;s
leg; and he turned and groaned, but without awaking.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out
of the darkness&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pieces of eight! pieces of eight! pieces of eight!
pieces of eight! pieces of eight!&rdquo; and so forth, without
pause or change, like the clacking of a tiny mill.</p>

<p>Silver&rsquo;s green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom
I had heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping
better watch than any human being, who thus announced
my arrival with her wearisome refrain.</p>

<p>I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping
tone of the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and
with a mighty oath, the voice of Silver cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned to run, struck violently against one person,
recoiled, and ran full into the arms of a second, who, for his
part, closed upon and held me tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring a torch, Dick,&rdquo; said Silver, when my capture
was thus assured.</p>

<p>And one of the men left the log-house and presently
returned with a lighted brand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>

<h5>IN THE ENEMY&rsquo;S CAMP</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the
block-house, showed me the worst of my apprehensions
realised. The pirates were in possession of the house and
stores: there was the cask of cognac, there were the pork
and bread, as before; and, what tenfold increased my
horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge that
all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had
not been there to perish with them.</p>

<p>There were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another
man was left alive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed
and swollen, suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness.
The sixth had only risen upon his elbow: he was
deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round his head
told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently
dressed. I remembered the man who had been shot
and had run back among the woods in the great attack, and
doubted not that this was he.</p>

<p>The parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John&rsquo;s
shoulder. He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler
and more stern than I was used to. He still wore the fine
broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission, but it
was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and torn
with the sharp briers of the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers!
dropped in, like, eh? Well, come, I take that friendly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask, and
began to fill a pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a loan of the link, Dick,&rdquo; said he; and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
when he had a good light, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll do, lad,&rdquo; he added;
&ldquo;stick the glim in the wood-heap; and you, gentlemen,
bring yourselves to!&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t stand up for Mr. Hawkins;
<i>he&rsquo;ll</i> excuse you, you may lay to that. And so, Jim&rdquo;&mdash;stopping
the tobacco&mdash;&ldquo;here you were, and quite a
pleasant surprise for poor old John. I see you were smart
when first I set my eyes on you; but this here gets away
from me clean, it do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer.
They had set me with my back against the wall; and I stood
there, looking Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope,
to all outward appearance, but with black despair in my
heart.</p>

<p>Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure,
and then ran on again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you see, Jim, so be as you <i>are</i> here,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a piece of my mind. I&rsquo;ve always liked you,
I have, for a lad of spirit, and the picter of my own self
when I was young and handsome. I always wanted you to
jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my
cock, you&rsquo;ve got to. Cap&rsquo;n Smollett&rsquo;s a fine seaman, as
I&rsquo;ll own up to any day, but stiff on discipline. &lsquo;Dooty is
dooty,&rsquo; says he, and right he is. Just you keep clear of the
cap&rsquo;n. The doctor himself is gone dead again you&mdash;&lsquo;ungrateful
scamp&rsquo; was what he said; and the short and the
long of the whole story is about here: you can&rsquo;t go back to
your own lot, for they won&rsquo;t have you; and, without you
start a third ship&rsquo;s company all by yourself, which might be
lonely, you&rsquo;ll have to jine with Cap&rsquo;n Silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and
though I partly believed the truth of Silver&rsquo;s statement,
that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion,
I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say nothing as to your being in our hands,&rdquo;
continued Silver, &ldquo;though there you are, and you may lay
to it. I&rsquo;m all for argyment; I never seen good come out o&rsquo;
threatening. If you like the service, well, you&rsquo;ll jine; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
if you don&rsquo;t, Jim, why, you&rsquo;re free to answer no&mdash;free and
welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman,
shiver my sides!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to answer, then?&rdquo; I asked, with a very tremulous
voice. Through all this sneering talk I was made to
feel the threat of death that overhung me, and my cheeks
burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lad,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;no one&rsquo;s a-pressing of you. Take
your bearings. None of us won&rsquo;t hurry you, mate; time
goes so pleasant in your company, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, growing a bit bolder, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m to choose,
I declare I have a right to know what&rsquo;s what, and why
you&rsquo;re here, and where my friends are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s wot?&rdquo; repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep
growl. &ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;d be a lucky one as knowed that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you&rsquo;re
spoke to, my friend,&rdquo; cried Silver truculently to this speaker.
And then, in his first gracious tones, he replied to me:
&ldquo;Yesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the dog-watch,
down came Dr. Livesey with a flag of truce. Says
he, &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Silver, you&rsquo;re sold out. Ship&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo; Well,
maybe we&rsquo;d been taking a glass and a song to help it round.
I won&rsquo;t say no. Leastways none of us had looked out. We
looked out, and, by thunder! the old ship was gone. I
never seen a pack o&rsquo; fools look fishier; and you may lay to
that, if I tells you that looked the fishiest. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says the
doctor, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s bargain.&rsquo; We bargained, him and I, and
here we are: stores, brandy, block-house, the firewood you
was thoughtful enough to cut, and, in a manner of speaking,
the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for
them, they&rsquo;ve tramped; I don&rsquo;t know where&rsquo;s they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew again quietly at his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And lest you should take it into that head of yours,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;that you was included in the treaty, here&rsquo;s the
last word that was said: &lsquo;How many are you,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to
leave?&rsquo; &lsquo;Four,&rsquo; says he&mdash;&lsquo;four, and one of us wounded.
As for that boy, I don&rsquo;t know where he is, confound him,&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
says he, &lsquo;nor I don&rsquo;t much care. We&rsquo;re about sick of him.&rsquo;
These was his words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all that you&rsquo;re to hear, my son,&rdquo; returned
Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I am to choose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,&rdquo;
said Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am not such a fool but I know pretty
well what I have to look for. Let the worst come to the
worst, it&rsquo;s little I care. I&rsquo;ve seen too many die since I fell
in with you. But there&rsquo;s a thing or two I have to tell you,&rdquo;
I said, and by this time I was quite excited; &ldquo;and the first
is this: here you are, in a bad way: ship lost, treasure lost,
men lost; your whole business gone to wreck; and if you
want to know who did it&mdash;it was I! I was in the apple-barrel
the night we sighted land, and I heard you, John, and
you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at the bottom
of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was
out. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable,
and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her, and
it was I who brought her where you&rsquo;ll never see her more,
not one of you. The laugh&rsquo;s on my side; I&rsquo;ve had the top
of this business from the first; I no more fear you than I
fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one
thing I&rsquo;ll say, and no more: if you spare me, bygones are
bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I&rsquo;ll
save you all I can. It is for you to choose. Kill another
and do yourselves no good, or spare me and keep a witness
to save you from the gallows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and, to my
wonder, not a man of them moved, but all sat staring at me
like as many sheep. And while they were still staring, I
broke out again:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Silver,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re the
best man here, and if things go the worst, I&rsquo;ll take it kind of
you to let the doctor know the way I took it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bear it in mind,&rdquo; said Silver, with an accent so
curious that I could not, for the life of me, decide whether
he were laughing at my request, or had been favourably
affected by my courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put one to that,&rdquo; cried the old mahogany-faced
seaman&mdash;Morgan by name&mdash;whom I had seen in Long
John&rsquo;s public-house upon the quays of Bristol. &ldquo;It was
him that knowed Black Dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and see here,&rdquo; added the sea-cook. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put
another again to that, by thunder! for it was this same boy
that faked the chart from Billy Bones. First and last,
we&rsquo;ve split upon Jim Hawkins!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then here goes!&rdquo; said Morgan, with an oath.</p>

<p>And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been
twenty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast there!&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;Who are you, Tom
Morgan? Maybe you thought you was cap&rsquo;n here, perhaps.
By the powers, but I&rsquo;ll teach you better! Cross me,
and you&rsquo;ll go where many a good man&rsquo;s gone before you,
first and last, these thirty year back&mdash;some to the yard-arm,
shiver my sides! and some by the board, and all to feed the
fishes. There&rsquo;s never a man looked me between the eyes
and seen a good day a&rsquo;terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay
to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morgan paused; but a hoarse murmur rose from the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stood hazing long enough from one,&rdquo; added another.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I&rsquo;ll be hazed by you, John Silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with
<i>me</i>?&rdquo; roared Silver, bending far forward from his position
on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand.
&ldquo;Put a name on what you&rsquo;re at; you ain&rsquo;t dumb, I reckon.
Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years,
and a son of a rum-puncheon cock his hat athwart my
hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you&rsquo;re
all gentlemen o&rsquo; fortune, by your account. Well, I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
ready. Take a cutlass, him that dares, and I&rsquo;ll see the
colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe&rsquo;s
empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a man stirred; not a man answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your sort, is it?&rdquo; he added, returning his pipe
to his mouth. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a gay lot to look at, anyway.
Not much worth to fight, you ain&rsquo;t. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you can understand
King George&rsquo;s English. I&rsquo;m cap&rsquo;n here by &rsquo;lection.
I&rsquo;m cap&rsquo;n here because I&rsquo;m the best man by a long sea-mile.
You won&rsquo;t fight, as gentlemen o&rsquo; fortune should; then, by
thunder, you&rsquo;ll obey, and you may lay to it! I like that
boy, now; I never seen a better boy than that. He&rsquo;s more
a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house, and
what I say is this: let me see him that&rsquo;ll lay a hand on him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what I say, and you may lay to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long pause after this. I stood straight up
against the wall, my heart still going like a sledge-hammer,
but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom. Silver
leant back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the
corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had been in
church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept
the tail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part,
drew gradually together towards the far end of the block-house,
and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my
ear continuously like a stream. One after another they
would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a
second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me,
it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to have a lot to say,&rdquo; remarked Silver,
spitting far into the air. &ldquo;Pipe up and let me hear it, or
lay-to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ax your pardon, sir,&rdquo; returned one of the men, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
pretty free with some of the rules; maybe you&rsquo;ll kindly keep
an eye upon the rest. This crew&rsquo;s dissatisfied; this crew don&rsquo;t
vally bullying a marlinspike; this crew has its rights like
other crews, I&rsquo;ll make so free as that; and by your own rules
I take it we can talk together. I ax your pardon, sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
acknowledging you to be capting at this present; but I
claim my right, and steps outside for a council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking,
yellow-eyed man of five-and-thirty, stepped coolly
towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One
after another, the rest followed his example; each making
a salute as he passed; each adding some apology. &ldquo;According
to rules,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le council,&rdquo; said Morgan.
And so with one remark or another, all marched out, and left
Silver and me alone with the torch.</p>

<p>The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins,&rdquo; he said, in a
steady whisper, that was no more than audible, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
within half a plank of death, and, what&rsquo;s a long sight worse,
of torture. They&rsquo;re going to throw me off. But, you mark,
I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn&rsquo;t mean to;
no, not till you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose
that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain. But I
see you was the right sort. I says to myself: You stand by
Hawkins, John, and Hawkins&rsquo;ll stand by you. You&rsquo;re his
last card, and, by the living thunder, John, he&rsquo;s yours!
Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he&rsquo;ll
save your neck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began dimly to understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean all&rsquo;s lost?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, by gum, I do!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Ship gone, neck
gone&mdash;that&rsquo;s the size of it. Once I looked into that bay,
Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m tough, but I
gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me,
they&rsquo;re outright fools and cowards. I&rsquo;ll save your life&mdash;if
so be as I can&mdash;from them. But, see here, Jim&mdash;tit for tat&mdash;you
save Long John from swinging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was
asking&mdash;he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I can do, that I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain!&rdquo; cried Long John. &ldquo;You speak up
plucky, and, by thunder! I&rsquo;ve a chance.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among
the firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understand me, Jim,&rdquo; he said, returning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
head on my shoulders, I have. I&rsquo;m on squire&rsquo;s side now.
I know you&rsquo;ve got that ship safe somewheres. How you
done it I don&rsquo;t know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and
O&rsquo;Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of
<i>them</i>. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won&rsquo;t
let others. I know when a game&rsquo;s up, I do; and I know a
lad that&rsquo;s staunch. Ah, you that&rsquo;s young&mdash;you and me
might have done a power of good together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you taste, messmate?&rdquo; he asked; and when I
had refused: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take a drain myself, Jim,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I need a caulker, for there&rsquo;s trouble on hand. And, talking
o&rsquo; trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart,
Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw
the needlessness of further questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, he did, though,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s
something under that, no doubt&mdash;something, surely, under
that, Jim&mdash;bad or good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his
great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>

<h5>THE BLACK SPOT AGAIN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> council of the buccaneers had lasted some time, when
one of them re-entered the house, and with a repetition of
the same salute, which had in my eyes an ironical air,
begged for a moment&rsquo;s loan of the torch. Silver briefly
agreed; and this emissary retired again, leaving us together
in the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a breeze coming, Jim,&rdquo; said Silver, who had,
by this time, adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.</p>

<p>I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out.
The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves
out, and now glowed so low and duskily, that I understood
why these conspirators desired a torch. About half-way
down the slope to the stockade they were collected in a
group; one held the light; another was on his knees in their
midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand
with varying colours, in the moon and torchlight. The
rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching the
man&oelig;uvres of this last. I could just make out that he
had a book as well as a knife in his hand; and was still wondering
how anything so incongruous had come in their possession,
when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet,
and the whole party began to move together towards the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; said I; and I returned to my former
position, for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should
find me watching them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let &rsquo;em come, lad&mdash;let &rsquo;em come,&rdquo; said Silver,
cheerily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve still a shot in my locker.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together
just inside, pushed one of their number forward. In
any other circumstances it would have been comical to see
his slow advance, hesitating as he set down each foot, but
holding his closed right hand in front of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Step up, lad,&rdquo; cried Silver. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t eat you. Hand
it over, lubber. I know the rules, I do; I won&rsquo;t hurt a
depytation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more
briskly, and having passed something to Silver, from hand
to hand, slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions.</p>

<p>The sea-cook looked at what had been given him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The black spot! I thought so,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;Where might you have got the paper? Why, hillo! look
here, now: this ain&rsquo;t lucky! You&rsquo;ve gone and cut this out
of a Bible. What fool&rsquo;s cut a Bible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there!&rdquo; said Morgan&mdash;&ldquo;there! Wot did I say?
No good&rsquo;ll come o&rsquo; that, I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve about fixed it now, among you,&rdquo; continued
Silver. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll all swing now, I reckon. What
soft-headed lubber had a Bible?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Dick,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,&rdquo; said
Silver. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may
lay to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Belay that talk, John Silver,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This crew
has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty
bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see
what&rsquo;s wrote there. Then you can talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanky, George,&rdquo; replied the sea-cook. &ldquo;You
always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart,
George, as I&rsquo;m pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway?
Ah! &lsquo;Deposed&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to
be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o&rsquo; write, George.
Why, you was gettin&rsquo; quite a leadin&rsquo; man in this here crew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
You&rsquo;ll be cap&rsquo;n next, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Just oblige me
with that torch again, will you? this pipe don&rsquo;t draw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t fool this crew no
more. You&rsquo;re a funny man, by your account; but you&rsquo;re
over now, and you&rsquo;ll maybe step down off that barrel, and
help vote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said you knowed the rules,&rdquo; returned
Silver contemptuously. &ldquo;Leastways, if you don&rsquo;t, I do;
and I wait here&mdash;and I&rsquo;m still your cap&rsquo;n, mind&mdash;till you
outs with your grievances, and I reply; in the meantime,
your black spot ain&rsquo;t worth a biscuit. After that, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied George, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t be under no kind of
apprehension; <i>we&rsquo;re</i> all square, we are. First, you&rsquo;ve made
a hash of this cruise&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be a bold man to say no to that.
Second, you let the enemy out o&rsquo; this here trap for nothing.
Why did they want out? I dunno; but it&rsquo;s pretty plain
they wanted it. Third, you wouldn&rsquo;t let us go at them upon
the march. Oh, we see through you, John Silver; you
want to play booty, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with you. And
then, fourth, there&rsquo;s this here boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Silver quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough, too,&rdquo; retorted George. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all swing and
sun-dry for your bungling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, look here, I&rsquo;ll answer these four p&rsquo;ints;
one after another I&rsquo;ll answer &rsquo;em. I made a hash o&rsquo; this
cruise, did I? Well, now, you all know what I wanted:
and you all know, if that had been done, that we&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; been
aboard the <i>Hispaniola</i> this night as ever was, every man of
us alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure
in the hold of her, by thunder! Well, who crossed me?
Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap&rsquo;n? Who tipped
me the black spot the day we landed, and began this dance?
Ah, it&rsquo;s a fine dance&mdash;I&rsquo;m with you there&mdash;and looks mighty
like a hornpipe in a rope&rsquo;s end at Execution Dock by London
town, it does. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson,
and Hands, and you, George Merry! And you&rsquo;re the
last above board of that same meddling crew; and you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the Davy Jones&rsquo;s insolence to up and stand for cap&rsquo;n over
me&mdash;you, that sank the lot of us! By the powers! but this
tops the stiffest yarn to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George
and his late comrades that these words had not been said
in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for number one,&rdquo; cried the accused, wiping the
sweat from his brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence
that shook the house. &ldquo;Why, I give you my word,
I&rsquo;m sick to speak to you. You&rsquo;ve neither sense nor memory,
and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you
come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o&rsquo; fortune! I reckon tailors
is your trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, John,&rdquo; said Morgan. &ldquo;Speak up to the
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the others!&rdquo; returned John. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a nice
lot, ain&rsquo;t they? You say this cruise is bungled. Ah! by
gum, if you could understand how bad it&rsquo;s bungled, you
would see! We&rsquo;re that near the gibbet that my neck&rsquo;s
stiff with thinking on it. You&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em, maybe, hanged
in chains, birds about &rsquo;em, seamen p&rsquo;inting &rsquo;em out as they
go down with the tide. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; says one. &lsquo;That!
Why, that&rsquo;s John Silver. I knowed him well,&rsquo; says another.
And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go about and
reach for the other buoy. Now that&rsquo;s about where we are,
every mother&rsquo;s son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and
Anderson, and other ruination fools of you. And if you
want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver
my timbers, isn&rsquo;t he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste
a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Kill that boy? not me, mates! And
number three? Ah, well, there&rsquo;s a deal to say to number
three. Maybe you don&rsquo;t count it nothing to have a real
college doctor come to see you every day&mdash;you, John, with
your head broke&mdash;or you, George Merry, that had the ague-shakes
upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the
colour of lemon-peel to this same moment on the clock?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
And maybe, perhaps, you didn&rsquo;t know there was a consort
coming, either? But there is; and not so long till then; and
we&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to
that. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain&mdash;well,
you came crawling on your knees to me to make it&mdash;on
your knees you came, you was that downhearted&mdash;and
you&rsquo;d have starved, too, if I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a trifle! you
look there&mdash;that&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly
recognised&mdash;none other than the chart on yellow paper, with
the three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the
bottom of the captain&rsquo;s chest. Why the doctor had given it
to him was more than I could fancy.</p>

<p>But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the
chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers. They
leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse. It went from hand
to hand, one tearing it from another; and by the oaths and
the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied
their examination, you would have thought, not only
they were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it,
besides, in safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Flint, sure enough. J. F.,
and a score below, with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty pretty,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;But how are we to
get away with it, and us no ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with
a hand against the wall: &ldquo;Now I give you warning, George,&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;One more word of your sauce, and I&rsquo;ll call you
down and fight you. How? Why, how do I know? You
had ought to tell me that&mdash;you and the rest, that lost me
my schooner, with your interference, burn you! But not
you, you can&rsquo;t; you hain&rsquo;t got the invention of a cockroach.
But civil you can speak, and shall, George Merry, you may
lay to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enow,&rdquo; said the old man Morgan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair! I reckon so,&rdquo; said the sea-cook. &ldquo;You lost
the ship; I found the treasure. Who&rsquo;s the better man at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
that? And now I resign, by thunder! Elect whom you
please to be your cap&rsquo;n now; I&rsquo;m done with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silver!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Barbecue for ever! Barbecue
for cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the toon, is it?&rdquo; cried the cook. &ldquo;George,
I reckon you&rsquo;ll have to wait another turn, friend: and
lucky for you as I&rsquo;m not a revengeful man. But that was
never my way. And now, shipmates, this black spot?
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much good now, is it? Dick&rsquo;s crossed his luck and
spoiled his Bible, and that&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do to kiss the book on still, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; growled
Dick, who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought
upon himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Bible with a bit cut out!&rdquo; returned Silver derisively.
&ldquo;Not it. It don&rsquo;t bind no more&rsquo;n a ballad-book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it, though?&rdquo; cried Dick, with a sort of joy.
&ldquo;Well, I reckon that&rsquo;s worth having, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Jim&mdash;here&rsquo;s a cur&rsquo;osity for you,&rdquo; said Silver;
and he tossed me the paper.</p>

<p>It was a round about the size of a crown-piece. One
side was blank, for it had been the last leaf; the other contained
a verse or two of Revelation&mdash;these words among the
rest, which struck sharply home upon my mind: &ldquo;Without
are dogs and murderers.&rdquo; The printed side had been
blackened with wood ash, which already began to come off
and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written with
the same material the one word &ldquo;Depposed.&rdquo; I have that
curiosity beside me at this moment; but not a trace of
writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a man
might make with his thumb-nail.</p>

<p>That was the end of the night&rsquo;s business. Soon after,
with a drink all round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside
of Silver&rsquo;s vengeance was to put George Merry up for sentinel,
and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful.</p>

<p>It was long ere I could close an eye, and Heaven knows
I had matter enough for thought in the man whom I had
slain that afternoon, in my own most perilous position, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
above all, in the remarkable game that I saw Silver now
engaged upon&mdash;keeping the mutineers together with one
hand, and grasping, with the other, after every means, possible
and impossible, to make his peace and save his miserable
life. He himself slept peacefully, and snored aloud;
yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he was, to think on
the dark perils that environed, and the shameful gibbet that
awaited him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX</h3>

<h5>ON PAROLE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">I was</span> wakened&mdash;indeed, we were all wakened, for I could
see even the sentinel shake himself together from where he
had fallen against the door-post&mdash;by a clear, hearty voice
hailing us from the margin of the wood:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Block-house, ahoy!&rdquo; it cried. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the doctor it was. Although I was glad to hear the
sound, yet my gladness was not without admixture. I remembered
with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy
conduct; and when I saw where it had brought me&mdash;among
what companions and surrounded by what dangers&mdash;I felt
ashamed to look him in the face.</p>

<p>He must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly
come; and when I ran to a loophole and looked out, I saw
him standing, like Silver once before, up to the mid-leg in
creeping vapour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, doctor! Top o&rsquo; the morning to you, sir!&rdquo; cried
Silver, broad awake and beaming with good-nature in a
moment. &ldquo;Bright and early, to be sure; and it&rsquo;s the early
bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.&mdash;George,
shake up your timbers, son, and help Dr. Livesey over the
ship&rsquo;s side. All a-doin&rsquo; well, your patients was&mdash;all well
and merry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he pattered on, standing on the hill-top, with his
crutch under his elbow, and one hand upon the side of the
log-house&mdash;quite the old John in voice, manner, and expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve quite a surprise for you too, sir,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a little stranger here&mdash;he! he! A noo boarder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
lodger, sir, and looking fit and taut as a fiddle; slep&rsquo; like a
supercargo, he did, right alongside of John&mdash;stem to stem
we was, all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and
pretty near the cook; and I could hear the alteration in his
voice as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very same Jim as ever was,&rdquo; says Silver.</p>

<p>The doctor stopped outright, although he did not
speak, and it was some seconds before he seemed able to
move on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;duty first and pleasure
afterwards, as you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us
overhaul these patients of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment afterwards he had entered the block-house,
and, with one grim nod to me, proceeded with his work
among the sick. He seemed under no apprehension,
though he must have known that his life, among these
treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on
to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional
visit in a quiet English family. His manner, I suppose,
reacted on the men; for they behaved to him as if nothing
had occurred&mdash;as if he were still ship&rsquo;s doctor, and they still
faithful hands before the mast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing well, my friend,&rdquo; he said to the fellow
with the bandaged head, &ldquo;and if ever any person had a close
shave, it was you; your head must be as hard as iron.&mdash;Well,
George, how goes it? You&rsquo;re a pretty colour, certainly;
why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take
that medicine?&mdash;did he take that medicine, men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir, he took it, sure enough,&rdquo; returned Morgan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, you see, since I am mutineers&rsquo; doctor, or
prison doctor, as I prefer to call it,&rdquo; says Dr. Livesey, in his
pleasantest way, &ldquo;I make it a point of honour not to lose
a man for King George (God bless him!) and the gallows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rogues looked at each other, but swallowed the
home-thrust in silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick don&rsquo;t feel well, sir,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;Well, step up here,
Dick, and let me see your tongue. No, I should be surprised
if he did! the man&rsquo;s tongue is fit to frighten the
French. Another fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;that comed of sp&rsquo;iling
Bibles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That comed&mdash;as you call it&mdash;of being arrant asses,&rdquo;
retorted the doctor, &ldquo;and not having sense enough to know
honest air from poison, and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous
slough. I think it most probable&mdash;though, of course,
it&rsquo;s only an opinion&mdash;that you&rsquo;ll all have the deuce to pay
before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp in a
bog, would you?&mdash;Silver, I&rsquo;m surprised at you. You&rsquo;re
less a fool than many, take you all round; but you don&rsquo;t
appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules
of health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added, after he had dosed them round, and
they had taken his prescriptions with really laughable
humility, more like charity-school children than blood-guilty
mutineers and pirates&mdash;&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s done for to-day.
And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy,
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.</p>

<p>George Merry was at the door, spitting and spluttering
over some bad-tasted medicine; but at the first word of the
doctor&rsquo;s proposal he swung round with a deep flush, and
cried &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and swore.</p>

<p>Silver struck the barrel with his open hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Si-lence!&rdquo; he roared, and looked about him positively
like a lion. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he went on, in his usual tones, &ldquo;I
was a-thinking of that, knowing as how you had a fancy for
the boy. We&rsquo;re all humbly grateful for your kindness, and,
as you see, puts faith in you, and takes the drugs down like
that much grog. And I take it, I&rsquo;ve found a way as&rsquo;ll suit
all.&mdash;Hawkins, will you give me your word of honour as a
young gentleman&mdash;for a young gentleman you are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
although poor born&mdash;your word of honour not to slip
your cable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I readily gave the pledge required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, doctor,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;you just step outside o&rsquo;
that stockade, and once you&rsquo;re there, I&rsquo;ll bring the boy
down on the inside, and I reckon you can yarn through the
spars. Good-day to you, sir, and all our dooties to the
squire and Cap&rsquo;n Smollett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver&rsquo;s
black looks had restrained, broke out immediately the
doctor had left the house. Silver was roundly accused of
playing double&mdash;of trying to make a separate peace for himself&mdash;of
sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and
victims; and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that
he was doing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that
I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. But he
was twice the man the rest were; and his last night&rsquo;s victory
had given him a huge preponderance on their minds. He
called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine, said it
was necessary I should talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart
in their faces, asked them if they could afford to break the
treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, by thunder!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s us must break the
treaty when the time comes; and till then I&rsquo;ll gammon that
doctor, if I have to ile his boots with brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out
upon his crutch, with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them
in a disarray, and silenced by his volubility rather than
convinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slow, lad, slow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They might round upon
us in a twinkle of an eye, if we was seen to hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand
to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the
stockade, and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance,
Silver stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a note of this here also, doctor,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;and the boy&rsquo;ll tell you how I saved his life, and were de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>posed
for it, too, and you may lay to that. Doctor, when a
man&rsquo;s steering as near the wind as me&mdash;playing chuck-farthing
with the last breath in his body, like&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t think
it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? You&rsquo;ll
please bear in mind it&rsquo;s not my life only now&mdash;it&rsquo;s that boy&rsquo;s
into the bargain; and you&rsquo;ll speak me fair, doctor, and give
me a bit o&rsquo; hope to go on, for the sake of mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver was a changed man, once he was out there and had
his back to his friends and the block-house; his cheeks
seemed to have fallen in, his voice trembled; never was a
soul more dead in earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, John, you&rsquo;re not afraid?&rdquo; asked Doctor Livesey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, I&rsquo;m no coward; no, not I&mdash;not <i>so</i> much!&rdquo;
and he snapped his fingers. &ldquo;If I was I wouldn&rsquo;t say it.
But I&rsquo;ll own up fairly, I&rsquo;ve the shakes upon me for the gallows.
You&rsquo;re a good man and a true; I never seen a better man!
And you&rsquo;ll not forget what I done good, not any more than
you&rsquo;ll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside&mdash;see here&mdash;and
leave you and Jim alone. And you&rsquo;ll put that down for
me too, for it&rsquo;s a long stretch, is that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of
earshot, and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began
to whistle; spinning round now and again upon his seat so
as to command a sight, sometimes of me and the doctor, and
sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in
the sand, between the fire&mdash;which they were busy rekindling&mdash;and
the house, from which they brought forth pork and
bread to make the breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Jim,&rdquo; said the doctor sadly, &ldquo;here you are. As
you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven
knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you; but this
much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain
Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when
he was ill, and couldn&rsquo;t help it, by George, it was downright
cowardly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will own that I here began to weep. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;you might spare me. I have blamed myself enough;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
my life&rsquo;s forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by
now, if Silver hadn&rsquo;t stood for me; and, doctor, believe this,
I can die&mdash;and I daresay I deserve it&mdash;but what I fear is
torture. If they come to torture me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite
changed, &ldquo;Jim, I can&rsquo;t have this. Whip over, and we&rsquo;ll
run for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I passed my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help that,
Jim, now. I&rsquo;ll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame
and shame, my boy; but stay here I cannot let you.
Jump! One jump, and you&rsquo;re out, and we&rsquo;ll run for
it like antelopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you know right well you wouldn&rsquo;t do
the thing yourself; neither you, nor squire, nor captain;
and no more will I. Silver trusted me; I passed my word,
and back I go. But, doctor, you did not let me finish. If
they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of where the
ship is; for I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking,
and she lies in North Inlet, on the southern beach, and just
below high water. At half-tide she must be high and dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he
heard me out in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a kind of fate in this,&rdquo; he observed, when I
had done. &ldquo;Every step, it&rsquo;s you that saves our lives; and
do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you
lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy. You
found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn&mdash;the best deed
that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety.
Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! why, this is the
mischief in person. Silver!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Silver!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give
you a piece of advice,&rdquo; he continued, as the cook drew near
again; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you be in any great hurry after that
treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, I do my possible, which that ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Silver. &ldquo;I can only, asking your pardon, save my life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the boy&rsquo;s by seeking for that treasure; and you may lay to
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Silver,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;if that is so, I&rsquo;ll go
one step further: look out for squalls when you find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;as between man and man, that&rsquo;s
too much and too little. What you&rsquo;re after, why you left
the block-house, why you given me that there chart, I don&rsquo;t
know, now, do I? and yet I done your bidding with my eyes
shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here&rsquo;s too
much. If you won&rsquo;t tell me what you mean plain out, just
say so, and I&rsquo;ll leave the helm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the doctor musingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no right to say
more; it&rsquo;s not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my
word, I&rsquo;d tell it you. But I&rsquo;ll go as far with you as I dare
go, and a step beyond; for I&rsquo;ll have my wig sorted by the
captain, or I&rsquo;m mistaken! And, first, I&rsquo;ll give you a bit of
hope: Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I&rsquo;ll
do my best to save you, short of perjury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silver&rsquo;s face was radiant. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t say more,
I&rsquo;m sure, sir, not if you was my mother,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s my first concession,&rdquo; added the doctor.
&ldquo;My second is a piece of advice: Keep the boy close beside
you, and when you need help, halloo. I&rsquo;m off to seek it for
you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random.&mdash;Good-bye,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the
stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into
the wood.</p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI</h3>

<h5>THE TREASURE HUNT&mdash;FLINT&rsquo;S POINTER</h5>

<p class="noind">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jim</span>,&rdquo; said Silver, when we were alone, &ldquo;if I saved your life,
you saved mine; and I&rsquo;ll not forget it. I seen the doctor
waving you to run for it&mdash;with the tail of my eye, I did; and
I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that&rsquo;s one to
you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack
failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we&rsquo;re to go in
for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders, too, and
I don&rsquo;t like it; and you and me must stick close, back to
back like, and we&rsquo;ll save our necks in spite o&rsquo; fate and
fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast
was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about
the sand over biscuit and fried junk. They had lit a fire fit
to roast an ox; and it was now grown so hot that they could
only approach it from the windward, and even there not
without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had
cooked, I suppose, three times more than we could eat; and
one of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was left into
the fire, which blazed and roared again over this unusual
fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow;
hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way
of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries,
though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with
it, I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged
campaign.</p>

<p>Even Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon
his shoulder, had not a word of blame for their reck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>lessness.
And this the more surprised me, for I thought he
had never shown himself so cunning as he did then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, mates,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s lucky you have Barbecue
to think for you with this here head. I got what I wanted,
I did. Sure enough, they have the ship. Where they have
it, I don&rsquo;t know yet; but once we hit the treasure, we&rsquo;ll
have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us
that has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot
bacon: thus he restored their hope and confidence, and, I
more than suspect, repaired his own at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for hostage,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s his last talk, I
guess, with them he loves so dear. I&rsquo;ve got my piece o&rsquo;
news, and thanky to him for that; but it&rsquo;s over and done.
I&rsquo;ll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting, for we&rsquo;ll
keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark,
and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and treasure
both, and off to sea like jolly companions, why, then, we&rsquo;ll
talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we&rsquo;ll give him his share,
to be sure, for all his kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now.
For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme
he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a
traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot
in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer
wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from
hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side.</p>

<p>Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to
keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay
before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions
of his followers turned to certainty, and he and I
should have to fight for dear life&mdash;he, a cripple, and I, a boy&mdash;against
five strong and active seamen!</p>

<p>Add to this double apprehension, the mystery that still
hung over the behaviour of my friends; their unexplained
desertion of the stockade; their inexplicable cession of the
chart; or, harder still to understand, the doctor&rsquo;s last warn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>ing
to Silver, &ldquo;Look out for squalls when you find it;&rdquo; and
you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast,
and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my
captors on the quest for treasure.</p>

<p>We made a curious figure, had any one been there to see
us; all in soiled sailor clothes, and all but me armed to the
teeth. Silver had two guns slung about him&mdash;one before
and one behind&mdash;besides the great cutlass at his waist, and a
pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat. To complete
his strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his
shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk.
I had a line about my waist, and followed obediently
after the sea-cook, who held the loose end of the rope, now
in his free hand, now between his powerful teeth. For all
the world, I was led like a dancing bear.</p>

<p>The other men were variously burthened; some carrying
picks and shovels&mdash;for that had been the very first necessary
they brought ashore from the <i>Hispaniola</i>&mdash;others laden
with pork, bread, and brandy for the midday meal. All the
stores, I observed, came from our stock; and I could see the
truth of Silver&rsquo;s words the night before. Had he not struck
a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted
by the ship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water
and the proceeds of their hunting. Water would have been
little to their taste; a sailor is not usually a good shot; and,
besides all that, when they were so short of eatables, it was
not likely they would be very flush of powder.</p>

<p>Well, thus equipped, we all set out&mdash;even the fellow
with the broken head, who should certainly have kept in
shadow&mdash;and straggled, one after another, to the beach,
where the two gigs awaited us. Even these bore trace of the
drunken folly of the pirates, one in a broken thwart, and
both in their muddied and unbaled condition. Both were
to be carried along with us, for the sake of safety; and so,
with our numbers divided between them, we set forth upon
the bosom of the anchorage.</p>

<p>As we pulled over, there was some discussion on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
chart. The red cross was, of course, far too large to be a
guide; and the terms of the note on the back, as you will
hear, admitted of some ambiguity. They ran, the reader
may remember, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Tall tree, Spy-glass Shoulder, bearing a point to the <span class="scs">N.</span> of <span class="scs">N.N.E.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Skeleton Island <span class="scs">E.S.E.</span> and by <span class="scs">E.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten feet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>A tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right
before us, the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from
two to three hundred feet high, adjoining on the north the
sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass, and rising again
towards the south into the rough, cliffy eminence called the
Mizzen-mast Hill. The top of the plateau was dotted
thickly with pine trees of varying height. Every here and
there, one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear
above its neighbours, and which of these was the particular
&ldquo;tall tree&rdquo; of Captain Flint could only be decided on the
spot, and by the readings of the compass.</p>

<p>Yet, although that was the case, every man on board the
boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way
over, Long John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding
them wait till they were there.</p>

<p>We pulled easily, by Silver&rsquo;s directions, not to weary the
hands prematurely; and, after quite a long passage, landed
at the mouth of the second river&mdash;that which runs down a
woody cleft of the Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left,
we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau.</p>

<p>At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted,
marish vegetation, greatly delayed our progress; but by
little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony
under foot, and the wood to change its character and to grow
in a more open order. It was, indeed, a most pleasant
portion of the island that we were now approaching. A
heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost
taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg trees
were dotted here and there with the red columns and the
broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh
and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a
wonderful refreshment to our senses.</p>

<p>The party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting
and leaping to and fro. About the centre, and a good way
behind the rest, Silver and I followed&mdash;I tethered by my
rope, he ploughing, with deep pants, among the sliding
gravel. From time to time, indeed, I had to lend him a
hand, or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward
down the hill.</p>

<p>We had thus proceeded for about half a mile, and were
approaching the brow of the plateau, when the man upon
the farthest left began to cry aloud, as if in terror. Shout
after shout came from him, and the others began to run in
his direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; found the treasure,&rdquo; said old Morgan,
hurrying past us from the right, &ldquo;for that&rsquo;s clean a-top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it
was something very different. At the foot of a pretty big
pine, and involved in a green creeper, which had even
partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human skeleton
lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. I believe
a chill struck for a moment to every heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a seaman,&rdquo; said George Merry, who, bolder than
the rest, had gone up close, and was examining the rags of
clothing. &ldquo;Leastways, this is good sea-cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;like enough; you wouldn&rsquo;t
look to find a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a
way is that for bones to lie? &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t in natur&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to
fancy that the body was in a natural position. But for
some disarray (the work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed
upon him, or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually
enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight&mdash;his
feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his
head like a diver&rsquo;s, pointing directly in the opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken a notion into my old numskull,&rdquo; observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Silver. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the compass; there&rsquo;s the tip-top p&rsquo;int o&rsquo;
Skeleton Island, stickin&rsquo; out like a tooth. Just take a
bearing, will you, along the line of them bones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was done. The body pointed straight in the direction
of the island, and the compass read duly <span class="smcap">E.S.E.</span> and by <span class="smcap">E.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; cried the cook; &ldquo;this here is a p&rsquo;inter.
Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly
dollars. But, by thunder! if it don&rsquo;t make me cold inside
to think of Flint. This is one of <i>his</i> jokes, and no mistake.
Him and these six was alone here; he killed &rsquo;em, every man;
and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver
my timbers! They&rsquo;re long bones, and the hair&rsquo;s been yellow.
Ay, that would be Allardyce.&mdash;You mind Allardyce, Tom
Morgan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; returned Morgan, &ldquo;I mind him; he owed
me money, he did, and took my knife ashore with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of knives,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t we
find his&rsquo;n lying round? Flint warn&rsquo;t the man to pick a
seaman&rsquo;s pocket; and the birds, I guess, would leave it be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the powers, and that&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; cried Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a thing left here,&rdquo; said Merry, still feeling
round among the bones, &ldquo;not a copper doit nor a baccy-box.
It don&rsquo;t look nat&rsquo;ral to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, by gum, it don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Silver; &ldquo;not nat&rsquo;ral, nor
not nice, says you. Great guns! messmates, but if Flint
was living, this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six
they were, and six are we; and bones is what they are now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him dead with these here deadlights,&rdquo; said
Morgan. &ldquo;Billy took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces
on his eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;ay, sure enough he&rsquo;s dead and gone below,&rdquo;
said the fellow with the bandage; &ldquo;but if ever sperrit
walked, it would be Flint&rsquo;s. Dear heart, but he died bad,
did Flint!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that he did,&rdquo; observed another; &ldquo;now he raged,
and now he hollered for the rum, and now he sang. &lsquo;Fifteen
Men&rsquo; were his only song, mates; and I tell you true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
I never rightly liked to hear it since. It was main hot, and
the windy was open, and I hear that old song comin&rsquo; out as
clear as clear&mdash;and the death-haul on the man already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;stow this talk. He&rsquo;s
dead, and he don&rsquo;t walk, that I know; leastways, he won&rsquo;t
walk by day, and you may lay to that. Care killed a cat.
Fetch ahead for the doubloons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We started, certainly; but in spite of the hot sun and
the staring daylight, the pirates no longer ran separate and
shouting through the wood, but kept side by side and spoke
with bated breath. The terror of the dead buccaneer had
fallen on their spirits.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII</h3>

<h5>THE TREASURE HUNT&mdash;THE VOICE AMONG THE<br />
TREES</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Partly</span> from the damping influence of this alarm, partly to
rest Silver and the sick folk, the whole party sat down as
soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent.</p>

<p>The plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west,
this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect
on either hand. Before us, over the tree-tops, we
beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf; behind,
we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton
Island, but saw&mdash;clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands&mdash;a
great field of open sea upon the east. Sheer above
us rose the Spy-glass, here dotted with single pines, there
black with precipices. There was no sound but that of the
distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp
of countless insects in the brush. Not a man, not a sail upon
the sea; the very largeness of the view increased the sense
of solitude.</p>

<p>Silver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are three &lsquo;tall trees,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;about in the
right line from Skeleton Island. &lsquo;Spy-glass Shoulder,&rsquo; I
take it, means that lower p&rsquo;int there. It&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s-play to
find the stuff now. I&rsquo;ve half a mind to dine first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel sharp,&rdquo; growled Morgan. &ldquo;Thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
Flint&mdash;I think it were&mdash;&rsquo;as done me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; said
Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He were an ugly devil,&rdquo; cried a third pirate with a
shudder; &ldquo;that blue in the face, too!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That was how the rum took him,&rdquo; added Merry.
&ldquo;Blue! well, I reckon he was blue. That&rsquo;s a true word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon
this train of thought, they had spoken lower and lower, and
they had almost got to whispering by now, so that the sound
of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood. All
of a sudden, out of the middle of the trees in front of us, a
thin, high, trembling voice struck up the well-known air and
words:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen men on the dead man&rsquo;s chest&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the
pirates. The colour went from their six faces like enchantment;
some leaped to their feet, some clawed hold of others;
Morgan grovelled on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Flint, by &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; cried Merry.</p>

<p>The song had stopped as suddenly as it began&mdash;broken
off, you would have said, in the middle of a note, as though
some one had laid his hand upon the singer&rsquo;s mouth.
Coming so far through the clear, sunny atmosphere among
the green tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and
sweetly; and the effect on my companions was the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get
the word out, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do. Stand by to go about. This
is a rum start, and I can&rsquo;t name the voice: but it&rsquo;s some one
skylarking&mdash;some one that&rsquo;s flesh and blood, and you may
lay to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His courage had come back as he spoke, and some of the
colour to his face along with it. Already the others had
begun to lend an ear to this encouragement, and were coming
a little to themselves, when the same voice broke out again&mdash;not
this time singing, but in a faint distant hail, that echoed
yet fainter among the clefts of the Spy-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darby M&rsquo;Graw,&rdquo; it wailed&mdash;for that is the word that
best describes the sound&mdash;&ldquo;Darby M&rsquo;Graw! Darby
M&rsquo;Graw!&rdquo; again and again and again; and then rising a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
little higher, and with an oath that I leave out, &ldquo;Fetch aft
the rum, Darby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their
eyes starting from their heads. Long after the voice had
died away they still stared in silence, dreadfully, before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fixes it!&rdquo; gasped one. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They was his last words,&rdquo; moaned Morgan, &ldquo;his last
words above board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick had his Bible out, and was praying volubly. He
had been well brought up, had Dick, before he came to sea
and fell among bad companions.</p>

<p>Still, Silver was unconquered. I could hear his teeth
rattle in his head; but he had not yet surrendered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby,&rdquo; he
muttered: &ldquo;not one but us that&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; And then, making
a great effort: &ldquo;Shipmates,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to get
that stuff, and I&rsquo;ll not be beat by man nor devil. I never
was feared of Flint in his life, and, by the powers! I&rsquo;ll face
him dead. There&rsquo;s seven hundred thousand pound not a
quarter of a mile from here. When did ever a gentleman o&rsquo;
fortune show his stern to that much dollars, for a boosy old
seaman with a blue mug&mdash;and him dead, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no sign of re-awakening courage in his
followers; rather, indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence
of his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Belay there, John!&rdquo; said Merry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you cross
a sperrit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the rest were all too terrified to reply. They would
have run away severally had they dared; but fear kept
them together, and kept them close by John, as if his daring
helped them. He, on his part, had pretty well fought his
weakness down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sperrit? Well, maybe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one
thing not clear to me. There was an echo. Now, no man
ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well, then, what&rsquo;s he
doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That
ain&rsquo;t in natur&rsquo;, surely?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you
can never tell what will affect the superstitious, and, to my
wonder, George Merry was greatly relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a head upon your
shoulders, John, and no mistake. &rsquo;Bout ship, mates! This
here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe. And come to
think on it, it was like Flint&rsquo;s voice, I grant you, but not just
so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker somebody else&rsquo;s
voice now&mdash;it was liker&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the powers, Ben Gunn!&rdquo; roared Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, and so it were,&rdquo; cried Morgan, springing on his
knees. &ldquo;Ben Gunn it were!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make much odds, do it, now?&rdquo; asked Dick.
&ldquo;Ben Gunn&rsquo;s not here in the body, any more&rsquo;n Flint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn,&rdquo; cried Merry; &ldquo;dead
or alive, nobody minds him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned,
and how the natural colour had revived in their faces.
Soon they were chatting together, with intervals of listening;
and not long after, hearing no further sound, they
shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking first
with Silver&rsquo;s compass to keep them on the right line with
Skeleton Island. He had said the truth; dead or alive,
nobody minded Ben Gunn.</p>

<p>Dick alone still held his Bible, and looked around him as
he went, with fearful glances; but he found no sympathy,
and Silver even joked him on his precautions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;I told you, you had sp&rsquo;iled
your Bible. If it ain&rsquo;t no good to swear by, what do you
suppose a sperrit would give for it? Not that!&rdquo; and he
snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his crutch.</p>

<p>But Dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon
plain to me that the lad was falling sick; hastened by heat,
exhaustion, and the shock of his alarm, the fever, predicted
by Doctor Livesey, was evidently growing swiftly higher.</p>

<p>It was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
way lay a little down-hill, for, as I have said, the plateau
tilted towards the west. The pines, great and small, grew
wide apart: and even between the clumps of nutmeg and
azalea, wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine. Striking,
as we did, pretty near north-west across the island, we
drew, on the one hand, ever nearer under the shoulders of
the Spy-glass, and on the other, looked ever wider over that
western bay where I had once tossed and trembled in the
coracle.</p>

<p>The first of the tall trees was reached, and, by the bearing,
proved the wrong one. So with the second. The third
rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of
underwood; a giant of a vegetable, with a red column as big
as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a company
could have man&oelig;uvred. It was conspicuous far to sea both
on the east and west, and might have been entered as a
sailing mark upon the chart.</p>

<p>But it was not its size that now impressed my companions;
it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand
pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading
shadow. The thought of the money, as they drew nearer,
swallowed up their previous terrors. Their eyes burned in
their heads; their feet grew speedier and lighter; their
whole soul was bound up in that fortune, that whole lifetime
of extravagance and pleasure, that lay waiting there
for each of them.</p>

<p>Silver hobbled, grunting, on his crutch; his nostrils
stood out and quivered: he cursed like a madman when the
flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance; he plucked
furiously at the line that held me to him, and, from time to
time, turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look. Certainly
he took no pains to hide his thoughts; and certainly
I read them like print. In the immediate nearness of the
gold, all else had been forgotten; his promise and the
doctor&rsquo;s warning were both things of the past; and I could
not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure, find and
board the <i>Hispaniola</i> under cover of night, cut every honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
throat about that island, and sail away, as he had at first
intended, laden with crimes and riches.</p>

<p>Shaken as I was with these alarms, it was hard for me
to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasure-hunters.
Now and again I stumbled; and it was then that Silver
plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his
murderous glances. Dick, who had dropped behind us,
and now brought up the rear, was babbling to himself both
prayers and curses, as his fever kept rising. This also
added to my wretchedness, and, to crown all, I was haunted
by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on
that plateau, when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue
face&mdash;he who died at Savannah, singing and shouting for
drink&mdash;had there, with his own hand, cut down his six
accomplices. This grove, that was now so peaceful, must
then have rung with cries, I thought; and even with the
thought I could believe I heard it ringing still.</p>

<p>We were now at the margin of the thicket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huzza, mates, all together!&rdquo; shouted Merry; and the
foremost broke into a run.</p>

<p>And suddenly, not ten yards farther, we beheld them
stop. A low cry arose. Silver doubled his pace, digging
away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed; and
next moment he and I had come also to a dead halt.</p>

<p>Before us was a great excavation, not very recent, for
the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom.
In this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the
boards of several packing-cases strewn around. On one of
these boards I saw, branded with a hot iron, the name
<i>Walrus</i>&mdash;the name of Flint&rsquo;s ship.</p>

<p>All was clear to probation. The <i>cache</i> had been found
and rifled: the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>

<h5>THE FALL OF A CHIEFTAIN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">There</span> never was such an overturn in this world. Each of
these six men was as though he had been struck. But with
Silver the blow passed almost instantly. Every thought of
his soul had been set full-stretch, like a racer, on that money;
well, he was brought up in a single second, dead; and he
kept his head, found his temper, and changed his plan before
the others had had time to realise the disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;take that, and stand by for
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.</p>

<p>At the same time he began quietly moving northward,
and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and
the other five. Then he looked at me and nodded, as much
as to say, &ldquo;Here is a narrow corner,&rdquo; as, indeed, I thought
it was. His looks were now quite friendly; and I was so
revolted at these constant changes, that I could not forbear
whispering, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve changed sides again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no time left for him to answer in. The buccaneers,
with oaths and cries, began to leap, one after another,
into the pit, and to dig with their fingers, throwing
the boards aside as they did so. Morgan found a piece of
gold. He held it up with a perfect spout of oaths. It was
a two-guinea piece, and it went from hand to hand among
them for a quarter of a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two guineas!&rdquo; roared Merry, shaking it at Silver.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your seven hundred thousand pounds, is it?
You&rsquo;re the man for bargains, ain&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re him that
never bungled nothing, you wooden-headed lubber!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dig away, boys,&rdquo; said Silver, with the coolest insolence;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find some pig-nuts and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pig-nuts!&rdquo; repeated Merry, in a scream. &ldquo;Mates,
do you hear that? I tell you, now, that man there knew it
all along. Look in the face of him, and you&rsquo;ll see it wrote
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Merry,&rdquo; remarked Silver, &ldquo;standing for cap&rsquo;n
again? You&rsquo;re a pushing lad, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this time every one was entirely in Merry&rsquo;s favour.
They began to scramble out of the excavation, darting
furious glances behind them. One thing I observed, which
looked well for us: they all got out upon the opposite side
from Silver.</p>

<p>Well, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other,
the pit between us, and nobody screwed up high enough to
offer the first blow. Silver never moved; he watched them,
very upright on his crutch, and looked as cool as ever I saw
him. He was brave, and no mistake.</p>

<p>At last, Merry seemed to think a speech might help
matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mates,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s two of them alone there;
one&rsquo;s the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered
us down to this; the other&rsquo;s that cub that I mean to have
the heart of. Now, mates&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant
to lead a charge. But just then&mdash;crack! crack! crack!&mdash;three
musket-shots flashed out of the thicket. Merry
tumbled head-foremost into the excavation; the man with
the bandage spun round like a teetotum, and fell all his
length upon his side, where he lay dead, but still twitching;
and the other three turned and ran for it with all their
might.</p>

<p>Before you could wink, Long John had fired two barrels
of a pistol into the struggling Merry; and as the man rolled
up his eyes at him in the last agony, &ldquo;George,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
reckon I settled you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same moment the doctor, Gray, and Ben Gunn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
joined us, with smoking muskets, from among the nutmeg
trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;Double quick, my
lads! We must head &rsquo;em off the boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging
through the bushes to the chest.</p>

<p>I tell you, but Silver was anxious to keep up with us.
The work that man went through, leaping on his crutch till
the muscles of his chest were fit to burst, was work no sound
man ever equalled; and so thinks the doctor. As it was,
he was already thirty yards behind us, and on the verge of
strangling, when we reached the brow of the slope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he hailed, &ldquo;see there! no hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough there was no hurry. In a more open part
of the plateau, we could see the three survivors still running
in the same direction as they had started, right for Mizzen-mast
Hill. We were already between them and the boats;
and so we four sat down to breathe, while Long John, mopping
his face, came slowly up with us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye kindly, doctor,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;You came in in
about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins.&mdash;And so it&rsquo;s
you, Ben Gunn!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a nice one, to
be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ben Gunn, I am,&rdquo; replied the maroon, wriggling
like an eel in his embarrassment. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, after
a long pause, &ldquo;how do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank
ye, says you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben, Ben,&rdquo; murmured Silver, &ldquo;to think as you&rsquo;ve
done me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pickaxes, deserted,
in their flight, by the mutineers; and then, as we
proceeded leisurely down-hill to where the boats were lying,
related, in a few words, what had taken place. It was a
story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn,
the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to
end.</p>

<p>Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
had found the skeleton&mdash;it was he that had rifled it; he had
found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his
pickaxe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried
it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of a tall
pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east
angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety
since two months before the arrival of the <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<p>When the doctor had wormed this secret from him, on
the afternoon of the attack, and when, next morning, he saw
the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the
chart, which was now useless&mdash;given him the stores, for
Ben Gunn&rsquo;s cave was well supplied with goat&rsquo;s meat salted
by himself&mdash;given anything and everything to get a chance
of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed
hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the
money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for you, Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it went against my heart,
but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by
their duty; and if you were not one of these, whose fault was
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the
horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers,
he had run all the way to the cave, and, leaving squire to
guard the captain, had taken Gray and the maroon, and
started, making the diagonal across the island, to be at
hand beside the pine. Soon, however, he saw that our
party had the start of him: and Ben Gunn, being fleet of
foot, had been despatched in front to do his best alone.
Then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions
of his former shipmates; and he was so far successful that
Gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed
before the arrival of the treasure-hunters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Silver, &ldquo;it were fortunate for me that I had
Hawkins here. You would have let old John be cut to bits,
and never given it a thought, doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a thought,&rdquo; replied Dr. Livesey cheerily.</p>

<p>And by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
with the pickaxe, demolished one of them, and then we all
got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for
North Inlet.</p>

<p>This was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he
was almost killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar,
like the rest of us, and we were soon skimming swiftly over
a smooth sea. Soon we passed out of the straits and
doubled the south-east corner of the island, round which,
four days ago, we had towed the <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<p>As we passed the two-pointed hill we could see the black
mouth of Ben Gunn&rsquo;s cave, and a figure standing by it, leaning
on a musket. It was the squire; and we waved a handkerchief
and gave him three cheers, in which the voice of
Silver joined as heartily as any.</p>

<p>Three miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet,
what should we meet but the <i>Hispaniola</i>, cruising by herself?
The last flood had lifted her; and had there been much wind,
or a strong tide current, as in the southern anchorage, we
should never have found her more, or found her stranded
beyond help. As it was, there was little amiss, beyond the
wreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was got ready, and
dropped in a fathom and a half of water. We all pulled
round again to Rum Cove, the nearest point for Ben Gunn&rsquo;s
treasure-house; and then Gray, single-handed, returned
with the gig to the <i>Hispaniola</i>, where he was to pass the
night on guard.</p>

<p>A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of
the cave. At the top the squire met us. To me he was
cordial and kind, saying nothing of my escapade, either in
the way of blame or praise. At Silver&rsquo;s polite salute he
somewhat flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Silver,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a prodigious villain and
impostor&mdash;a monstrous impostor, sir. I am told I am not
to prosecute you. Well, then, I will not. But the dead
men, sir, hang about your neck like mill-stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly, sir,&rdquo; replied Long John, again
saluting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare you to thank me!&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;It is a
gross dereliction of my duty. Stand back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large,
airy place, with a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung
with ferns. The floor was sand. Before a big fire
lay Captain Smollett; and in a far corner, only duskily
flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin and
quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint&rsquo;s
treasure, that we had come so far to seek, and that had cost
already the lives of seventeen men from the <i>Hispaniola</i>.
How many it had cost in the amassing, what blood and
sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep, what brave
men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon,
what shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could
tell. Yet there were still three upon that island&mdash;Silver,
and old Morgan, and Ben Gunn&mdash;who had each taken his
share in these crimes, as each had hoped in vain to share in
the reward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Jim,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good
boy in your line, Jim; but I don&rsquo;t think you and me&rsquo;ll go to
sea again. You&rsquo;re too much of the born favourite for me.&mdash;Is
that you, John Silver? What brings you here, man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back to my dooty, sir,&rdquo; returned Silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the captain; and that was all he said.</p>

<p>What a supper I had of it that night, with all my friends
around me; and what a meal it was, with Ben Gunn&rsquo;s
salted goat, and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine
from the <i>Hispaniola</i>. Never, I am sure, were people gayer
or happier. And there was Silver, sitting back almost out
of the firelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward
when anything was wanted, even joining quietly in
our laughter&mdash;the same bland, polite, obsequious seaman of
the voyage out.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV</h3>

<h5>AND LAST</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation
of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to
the beach, and thence three miles by boat to the <i>Hispaniola</i>,
was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen.
The three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly
trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was
sufficient to insure us against any sudden onslaught, and
we thought, besides, they had had more than enough of
fighting.</p>

<p>Therefore the work was pushed on briskly. Gray and
Ben Gunn came and went with the boat, while the rest,
during their absences, piled treasure on the beach. Two
of the bars, slung in a rope&rsquo;s-end, made a good load for a
grown man&mdash;one that he was glad to walk slowly with. For
my part, as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy
all day in the cave, packing the minted money into bread-bags.</p>

<p>It was a strange collection, like Billy Bones&rsquo;s hoard for
the diversity of coinage, but so much larger and so much
more varied that I think I never had more pleasure than
in sorting them. English, French, Spanish, Portuguese,
Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and
moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe
for the last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped
with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider&rsquo;s web,
round pieces and square pieces, and pieces bored through
the middle, as if to wear them round your neck&mdash;nearly
every variety of money in the world must, I think, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure
they were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with
stooping and my fingers with sorting them out.</p>

<p>Day after day this work went on; by every evening a
fortune had been stowed aboard, but there was another
fortune waiting for the morrow; and all this time we heard
nothing of the three surviving mutineers.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;I think it was on the third night&mdash;the doctor
and I were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks
the lowlands of the isle, when, from out the thick
darkness below, the wind brought us a noise between shrieking
and singing. It was only a snatch that reached our ears,
followed by the former silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven forgive them,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the
mutineers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All drunk, sir,&rdquo; struck in the voice of Silver from
behind us.</p>

<p>Silver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and,
in spite of daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more
as quite a privileged and friendly dependant. Indeed, it
was remarkable how well he bore these slights, and with
what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate
himself with all. Yet, I think, none treated him better than
a dog; unless it was Ben Gunn, who was still terribly afraid
of his old quartermaster, or myself, who had really something
to thank him for; although for that matter, I suppose, I
had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else,
for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the
plateau. Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor
answered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drunk or raving,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you were, sir,&rdquo; replied Silver; &ldquo;and precious
little odds which, to you and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a
humane man,&rdquo; returned the doctor, with a sneer, &ldquo;and so
my feelings may surprise you, Master Silver. But if I
were sure they were raving&mdash;as I am morally certain one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
at least, of them is down with fever&mdash;I should leave this
camp, and, at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them
the assistance of my skill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,&rdquo;
quoth Silver. &ldquo;You would lose your precious life, and you
may lay to that. I&rsquo;m on your side now, hand and glove;
and I shouldn&rsquo;t wish for to see the party weakened, let alone
yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men
down there, they couldn&rsquo;t keep their word&mdash;no, not supposing
they wished to; and, what&rsquo;s more, they couldn&rsquo;t believe
as you could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the man to keep your
word, we know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, that was about the last news we had of the three
pirates. Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off,
and supposed them to be hunting. A council was held, and
it was decided that we must desert them on the island&mdash;to
the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong
approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot,
the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other
necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of
rope, and, by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome
present of tobacco.</p>

<p>That was about our last doing on the island. Before
that, we had got the treasure stowed, and had shipped
enough water and the remainder of the goat meat, in case
of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we weighed
anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and
stood out of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the
captain had flown and fought under at the palisade.</p>

<p>The three fellows must have been watching us closer
than we thought for, as we soon had proved. For, coming
through the narrows, we had to lie very near the southern
point, and there we saw all three of them kneeling together
on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in supplication. It
went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that wretched
state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of
kindness. The doctor hailed them, and told them of the
stores we had left, and where they were to find them. But
they continued to call us by name, and appeal to us, for
God&rsquo;s sake, to be merciful, and not leave them to die in such
a place.</p>

<p>At last, seeing the ship still bore on her course, and was
now swiftly drawing out of earshot, one of them&mdash;I know not
which it was&mdash;leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped
his musket to his shoulder, and sent a shot whistling over
Silver&rsquo;s head and through the main-sail.</p>

<p>After that we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when
next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit, and
the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing
distance. That was, at least, the end of that; and before
noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of Treasure
Island had sunk into the blue round of sea.</p>

<p>We were so short of men that every one on board had
to bear a hand&mdash;only the captain lying on a mattress in the
stern and giving his orders; for, though greatly recovered, he
was still in want of quiet. We laid her head for the nearest
port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the voyage
home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling
winds and a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before
we reached it.</p>

<p>It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most
beautiful land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded
by shore-boats full of negroes, and Mexican Indians, and
half-bloods, selling fruit and vegetables, and offering to dive
for bits of money. The sight of so many good-humoured
faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical fruits,
and, above all, the lights that began to shine in the town,
made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody
sojourn on the island; and the doctor and the squire, taking
me along with them, went ashore to pass the early part of
the night. Here they met the captain of an English man-of-war,
fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
short, had so agreeable a time, that day was breaking when
we came alongside the <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<p>Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and, as soon as we came on
board, he began, with wonderful contortions, to make us a
confession. Silver was gone. The maroon had connived at
his escape in a shore-boat some hours ago, and he now
assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which
would certainly have been forfeit if &ldquo;that man with the one
leg had stayed aboard.&rdquo; But this was not all. The sea-cook
had not gone empty-handed. He had cut through a
bulkhead unobserved, and had removed one of the sacks of
coin, worth, perhaps, three or four hundred guineas, to help
him on his further wanderings.</p>

<p>I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him.</p>

<p>Well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on
board, made a good cruise home, and the <i>Hispaniola</i> reached
Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was beginning to think of fitting
out her consort. Five men only of those who had sailed
returned with her. &ldquo;Drink and the devil had done for the
rest,&rdquo; with a vengeance; although, to be sure, we were not
quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">
<p class="ind03">&ldquo;With one man of her crew alive,</p>
<p>What put to sea with seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>All of us had an ample share of the treasure, and used it
wisely or foolishly, according to our natures. Captain
Smollett is now retired from the sea. Gray not only saved
his money, but, being suddenly smit with the desire to rise,
also studied his profession; and he is now mate and part
owner of a fine full-rigged ship; married besides, and the
father of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand
pounds, which he spent or lost in three weeks, or, to be more
exact, in nineteen days, for he was back begging on the
twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep, exactly as
he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great
favourite, though something of a butt, with the country
boys, and a notable singer in church on Sundays and saints&rsquo;
days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>Of Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring
man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life;
but I daresay he met his old negress, and perhaps still lives
in comfort with her and Captain Flint. It is to be hoped so,
I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another world are
very small.</p>

<p>The bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know,
where Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there
for me. Oxen and wain-ropes would not bring me back again
to that accursed island; and the worst dreams that ever I
have are when I hear the surf booming about its coasts, or
start upright in bed, with the sharp voice of Captain Flint
still ringing in my ears: &ldquo;Pieces of eight! pieces of eight!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WILL O&rsquo; THE MILL</h2>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<hr class="art" />
<h3>THE PLAIN AND THE STARS</h3>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Mill where Will lived with his adopted parents stood in
a falling valley between pinewoods and great mountains.
Above, hill after hill soared upwards until they soared out of
the depth of the hardiest timber, and stood naked against
the sky. Some way up, a long grey village lay like a seam
or a rag of vapour on a wooded hillside; and when the wind
was favourable, the sound of the church bells would drop
down, thin and silvery, to Will. Below, the valley grew
ever steeper and steeper, and at the same time widened out
on either hand; and from an eminence beside the mill it was
possible to see its whole length and away beyond it over a
wide plain, where the river turned and shone, and moved
on from city to city on its voyage towards the sea. It
chanced that over this valley there lay a pass into a neighbouring
kingdom; so that, quiet and rural as it was, the
road that ran along beside the river was a high thoroughfare
between two splendid and powerful societies. All through
the summer, travelling-carriages came crawling up, or went
plunging briskly downwards past the mill; and as it happened
that the other side was very much easier of ascent,
the path was not much frequented, except by people going
in one direction; and of all the carriages that Will saw go by,
five-sixths were plunging briskly downwards and only one-sixth
crawling up. Much more was this the case with foot-passengers.
All the light-footed tourists, all the pedlars
laden with strange wares, were tending downward like the
river that accompanied their path. Nor was this all; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
when Will was yet a child a disastrous war arose over a
great part of the world. The newspapers were full of defeats
and victories, the earth rang with cavalry hoofs, and often
for days together and for miles around the coil of battle terrified
good people from their labours in the field. Of all this,
nothing was heard for a long time in the valley; but at last
one of the commanders pushed an army over the pass by
forced marches, and for three days horse and foot, cannon
and tumbril, drum and standard, kept pouring downward
past the mill. All day the child stood and watched them on
their passage; the rhythmical stride, the pale, unshaven
faces tanned about the eyes, the discoloured regimentals,
and the tattered flags, filled him with a sense of weariness,
pity, and wonder; and all night long, after he was in bed,
he could hear the cannon pounding and the feet trampling,
and the great armament sweeping onward and downward
past the mill. No one in the valley ever heard the fate of
the expedition, for they lay out of the way of gossip in those
troublous times; but Will saw one thing plainly, that not a
man returned. Whither had they all gone? Whither
went all the tourists and pedlars with strange wares?
whither all the brisk barouches with servants in the dicky?
whither the water of the stream, ever coursing downward,
and ever renewed from above? Even the wind blew
oftener down the valley, and carried the dead leaves along
with it in the fall. It seemed like a great conspiracy of
things animate and inanimate; they all went downward,
fleetly and gaily downward, and only he, it seemed, remained
behind, like a stock upon the wayside. It sometimes
made him glad when he noticed how the fishes kept their
heads up stream. They, at least, stood faithfully by him,
while all else were posting downward to the unknown
world.</p>

<p>One evening he asked the miller where the river went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It goes down the valley,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;and turns a
power of mills&mdash;sixscore mills, they say, from here to Unterdeck&mdash;and
it none the wearier after all. And then it goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
out into the lowlands, and waters the great corn country,
and runs through a sight of fine cities (so they say) where
kings live all alone in great palaces, with a sentry walking
up and down before the door. And it goes under bridges
with stone men upon them, looking down and smiling so
curious at the water, and living folks leaning their elbows on
the wall and looking over too. And then it goes on and
on, and down through marshes and sands, until at last it
falls into the sea, where the ships are that bring parrots and
tobacco from the Indies. Ay, it has a long trot before it as it
goes singing over our weir, bless its heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the sea?&rdquo; asked Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sea!&rdquo; cried the miller. &ldquo;Lord help us all, it is
the greatest thing God made! That is where all the water
in the world runs down into a great salt lake. There it lies,
as flat as my hand, and as innocent-like as a child; but they
do say when the wind blows it gets up into water-mountains
bigger than any of ours, and swallows down great ships
bigger than our mill, and makes such a roaring that you can
hear it miles away upon the land. There are great fish in it
five times bigger than a bull, and one old serpent as long as
our river and as old as all the world, with whiskers like a
man, and a crown of silver on her head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will thought he had never heard anything like this, and
he kept on asking question after question about the world
that lay away down the river, with all its perils and marvels,
until the old miller became quite interested himself, and at
last took him by the hand and led him to the hill-top that
overlooks the valley and the plain. The sun was near setting,
and hung low down in a cloudless sky. Everything
was defined and glorified in golden light. Will had never
seen so great an expanse of country in his life; he stood and
gazed with all his eyes. He could see the cities, and the
woods and fields, and the bright curves of the river, and far
away to where the rim of the plain trenched along the shining
heavens. An overmastering emotion seized upon the boy,
soul and body; his heart beat so thickly that he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
breathe; the scene swam before his eyes; the sun seemed to
wheel round and round, and throw off, as it turned, strange
shapes which disappeared with the rapidity of thought, and
were succeeded by others. Will covered his face with his
hands, and burst into a violent fit of tears; and the poor
miller, sadly disappointed and perplexed, saw nothing
better for it than to take him up in his arms and carry him
home in silence.</p>

<p>From that day forward Will was full of new hopes and
longings. Something kept tugging at his heart-strings;
the running water carried his desires along with it as he
dreamed over its fleeting surface; the wind, as it ran
over innumerable tree-tops, hailed him with encouraging
words; branches beckoned downward; the open
road, as it shouldered round the angles and went turning
and vanishing fast and faster down the valley, tortured him
with its solicitations. He spent long whiles on the eminence,
looking down the rivershed and abroad on the fat lowlands,
and watched the clouds that travelled forth upon the
sluggish wind and trailed their purple shadows on the plain;
or he would linger by the wayside, and follow the carriages
with his eyes as they rattled downward by the river. It
did not matter what it was; everything that went that way,
were it cloud or carriage, bird or brown water in the stream,
he felt his heart flow out after it in an ecstasy of longing.</p>

<p>We are told by men of science that all the ventures of
mariners on the sea, all that counter-marching of tribes and
races that confounds old history with its dust and rumour,
sprang from nothing more abstruse than the laws of supply
and demand, and a certain natural instinct for cheap rations.
To any one thinking deeply, this will seem a dull and pitiful
explanation. The tribes that came swarming out of the
North and East, if they were indeed pressed onward from
behind by others, were drawn at the same time by the
magnetic influence of the South and West. The fame of
other lands had reached them; the name of the eternal city
rang in their ears; they were not colonists, but pilgrims;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
they travelled towards wine and gold and sunshine, but
their hearts were set on something higher. That divine
unrest, that old stinging trouble of humanity that makes all
high achievements and all miserable failure, the same that
spread wings with Icarus, the same that sent Columbus
into the desolate Atlantic, inspired and supported these
barbarians on their perilous march. There is one legend
which profoundly represents their spirit, of how a flying
party of these wanderers encountered a very old man shod
with iron. The old man asked them whither they were
going; and they answered with one voice: &ldquo;To the Eternal
City!&rdquo; He looked upon them gravely. &ldquo;I have sought
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;over the most part of the world. Three such
pairs as I now carry on my feet have I worn out upon this
pilgrimage, and now the fourth is growing slender underneath
my steps. And all this while I have not found the
city.&rdquo; And he turned and went his own way alone, leaving
them astonished.</p>

<p>And yet this would scarcely parallel the intensity of
Will&rsquo;s feeling for the plain. If he could only go far enough
out there, he felt as if his eyesight would be purged and
clarified, as if his hearing would grow more delicate, and his
very breath would come and go with luxury. He was
transplanted and withering where he was; he lay in a
strange country and was sick for home. Bit by bit, he
pieced together broken notions of the world below: of the
river, ever moving and growing until it sailed forth into the
majestic ocean; of the cities, full of brisk and beautiful
people, playing fountains, bands of music and marble
palaces, and lighted up at night from end to end with artificial
stars of gold; of the great churches, wise universities,
brave armies, and untold money lying stored in vaults; of
the high-flying vice that moved in the sunshine, and the
stealth and swiftness of midnight murder. I have said he
was sick as if for home: the figure halts. He was like some
one lying in twilit, formless pre-existence, and stretching
out his hands lovingly towards many-coloured, many-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>sounding
life. It was no wonder he was unhappy, he would
go and tell the fish: they were made for their life, wished
for no more than worms and running water, and a hole
below a falling bank; but he was differently designed, full
of desires and aspirations, itching at the fingers, lusting with
the eyes, whom the whole variegated world could not satisfy
with aspects. The true life, the true bright sunshine, lay far
out upon the plain. And, O! to see this sunlight once before
he died! to move with a jocund spirit in a golden land! to
hear the trained singers and sweet church bells, and see the
holiday gardens! &ldquo;And, O fish!&rdquo; he would cry, &ldquo;if you
would only turn your noses down stream, you could swim
so easily into the fabled waters and see the vast ships passing
over your head like clouds, and hear the great water-hills
making music over you all day long!&rdquo; But the fish kept
looking patiently in their own direction, until Will hardly
knew whether to laugh or cry.</p>

<p>Hitherto the traffic on the road had passed by Will, like
something seen in a picture: he had perhaps exchanged
salutations with a tourist, or caught sight of an old gentleman
in a travelling cap at a carriage window; but for the
most part it had been a mere symbol, which he contemplated
from apart and with something of a superstitious feeling.
A time came at last when this was to be changed. The
miller, who was a greedy man in his way, and never forewent
an opportunity of honest profit, turned the mill-house into a
little wayside inn, and, several pieces of good fortune falling
in opportunely, built stables and got the position of post-master
on the road. It now became Will&rsquo;s duty to wait
upon people, as they sat to break their fasts in the little
arbour at the top of the mill garden; and you may be sure
that he kept his ears open, and learned many new things
about the outside world as he brought the omelette or the
wine. Nay, he would often get into conversation with
single guests, and by adroit questions and polite attention,
not only gratify his own curiosity, but win the goodwill of
the travellers. Many complimented the old couple on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
serving-boy; and a professor was eager to take him away
with him, and have him properly educated in the plain.
The miller and his wife were mightily astonished, and even
more pleased. They thought it a very good thing that they
should have opened their inn. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the old man
would remark, &ldquo;he has a kind of talent for a publican; he
never would have made anything else!&rdquo; And so life wagged
on in the valley, with high satisfaction to all concerned but
Will. Every carriage that left the inn-door seemed to take
a part of him away with it; and when people jestingly
offered him a lift, he could with difficulty command his
emotion. Night after night he would dream that he was
awakened by flustered servants, and that a splendid equipage
waited at the door to carry him down into the plain;
night after night; until the dream, which had seemed all
jollity to him at first, began to take on a colour of gravity,
and the nocturnal summons and waiting equipage occupied
a place in his mind as something to be both feared and hoped
for.</p>

<p>One day, when Will was about sixteen, a fat young man
arrived at sunset to pass the night. He was a contented-looking
fellow, with a jolly eye, and carried a knapsack.
While dinner was preparing, he sat in the arbour to read a
book; but as soon as he had begun to observe Will, the
book was laid aside; he was plainly one of those who prefer
living people to people made of ink and paper. Will, on
his part, although he had not been much interested in the
stranger at first sight, soon began to take a great deal of pleasure
in his talk, which was full of good nature and good sense,
and at last conceived a great respect for his character and
wisdom. They sat far into the night; and about two in the
morning Will opened his heart to the young man, and told
him how he longed to leave the valley, and what bright
hopes he had connected with the cities of the plain. The
young man whistled, and then broke into a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;you are a very
curious little fellow, to be sure, and wish a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
things which you will never get. Why, you would feel quite
ashamed if you knew how the little fellows in these fairy
cities of yours are all after the same sort of nonsense, and keep
breaking their hearts to get up into the mountains. And
let me tell you, those who go down into the plains are a very
short while there before they wish themselves heartily back
again. The air is not so light nor so pure; nor is the sun
any brighter. As for the beautiful men and women, you
would see many of them in rags, and many of them deformed
with horrible disorders, and a city is so hard a place for
people who are poor and sensitive that many choose to die
by their own hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must think me very simple,&rdquo; answered Will.
&ldquo;Although I have never been out of this valley, believe me,
I have used my eyes. I know how one thing lives on another;
for instance, how the fish hangs in the eddy to catch
his fellows; and the shepherd, who makes so pretty a picture
carrying home the lamb, is only carrying it home for dinner.
I do not expect to find all things right in your cities. That
is not what troubles me; it might have been that once upon
a time; but although I live here always, I have asked many
questions and learned a great deal in these last years, and
certainly enough to cure me of my old fancies. But you
would not have me die like a dog and not see all that is to
be seen, and do all that a man can do, let it be good or evil?
you would not have me spend all my days between this road
here and the river, and not so much as make a motion to be
up and live my life?&mdash;I would rather die out of hand,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;than linger on as I am doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thousands of people,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;live and
die like you, and are none the less happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Will, &ldquo;if there are thousands who would
like, why should not one of them have my place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite dark; there was a hanging lamp in the
arbour which lit up the table and the faces of the speakers;
and along the arch, the leaves upon the trellis stood out illuminated
against the night sky, a pattern of transparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
green upon a dusky purple. The fat young man rose, and,
taking Will by the arm, led him out under the open heavens.
&ldquo;Did you ever look at the stars?&rdquo; he asked, pointing
upwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Often and often,&rdquo; answered Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you know what they are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have fancied many things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are worlds like ours,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them less; many of them a million times greater;
and some of the least sparkles that you see are not only
worlds but whole clusters of worlds turning about each other
in the midst of space. We do not know what there may be
in any of them; perhaps the answer to all our difficulties or
the cure of all our sufferings: and yet we can never reach
them; not all the skill of the craftiest of men can fit out a
ship for the nearest of these our neighbours, nor would the
life of the most aged suffice for such a journey. When a
great battle has been lost or a dear friend is dead, when we
are hipped or in high spirits, there they are, unweariedly
shining overhead. We may stand down here, a whole army
of us together, and shout until we break our hearts, and not
a whisper reaches them. We may climb the highest mountain,
and we are no nearer them. All we can do is to stand
down here in the garden and take off our hats; the starshine
lights upon our heads, and where mine is a little bald, I
daresay you can see it glisten in the darkness. The mountain
and the mouse. That is like to be all we shall ever have
to do with Arcturus or Aldebaran. Can you apply a
parable?&rdquo; he added, laying his hand upon Will&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not the same thing as a reason, but usually vastly
more convincing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will hung his head a little, and then raised it once more
to heaven. The stars seemed to expand and emit a sharper
brilliancy; and as he kept turning his eyes higher and
higher, they seemed to increase in multitude under his gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, turning to the young man. &ldquo;We are
in a rat-trap.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Something of that size. Did you ever see a squirrel
turning in a cage? and another squirrel sitting philosophically
over his nuts? I needn&rsquo;t ask you which of them looked
more of a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="art" />
<h3>THE PARSON&rsquo;S MARJORY</h3>

<p>After some years the old people died, both in one winter,
very carefully tended by their adopted son, and very quietly
mourned when they were gone. People who had heard of
his roving fancies supposed he would hasten to sell the property,
and go down the river to push his fortunes. But there
was never any sign of such an intention on the part of Will.
On the contrary, he had the inn set on a better footing, and
hired a couple of servants to assist him in carrying it on;
and there he settled down, a kind, talkative, inscrutable
young man, six feet three in his stockings, with an iron constitution
and a friendly voice. He soon began to take
rank in the district as a bit of an oddity: it was not much
to be wondered at from the first, for he was always full of
notions, and kept calling the plainest commonsense in
question; but what most raised the report upon him was
the odd circumstance of his courtship with the parson&rsquo;s
Marjory.</p>

<p>The parson&rsquo;s Marjory was a lass about nineteen, when
Will would be about thirty; well enough looking, and much
better educated than any other girl in that part of the
country, as became her parentage. She held her head very
high, and had already refused several offers of marriage
with a grand air, which had got her hard names among the
neighbours. For all that she was a good girl, and one that
would have made any man well contented.</p>

<p>Will had never seen much of her; for although the
church and parsonage were only two miles from his own
door, he was never known to go there but on Sundays. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
chanced, however, that the parsonage fell into disrepair,
and had to be dismantled; and the parson and his daughter
took lodgings for a month or so, on very much reduced terms,
at Will&rsquo;s inn. Now, what with the inn, and the mill, and
the old miller&rsquo;s savings, our friend was a man of substance;
and besides that he had a name for good temper and shrewdness,
which make a capital portion in marriage; and so it
was currently gossiped, among their ill-wishers, that the
parson and his daughter had not chosen their temporary
lodging with their eyes shut. Will was about the last man
in the world to be cajoled or frightened into marriage. You
had only to look into his eyes, limpid and still like pools of
water, and yet with a sort of clear light that seemed to come
from within, and you would understand at once that here
was one who knew his own mind, and would stand to it immovably.
Marjory herself was no weakling by her looks,
with strong, steady eyes and a resolute and quiet bearing.
It might be a question whether she was not Will&rsquo;s match in
steadfastness, after all, or which of them would rule the roast
in marriage. But Marjory had never given it a thought, and
accompanied her father with the most unshaken innocence
and unconcern.</p>

<p>The season was still so early that Will&rsquo;s customers were
few and far between; but the lilacs were already flowering,
and the weather was so mild that the party took dinner
under the trellis, with the noise of the river in their ears and
the woods ringing about them with the songs of birds. Will
soon began to take a particular pleasure in these dinners.
The parson was rather a dull companion, with a habit of
dozing at table; but nothing rude or cruel ever fell from his
lips. And as for the parson&rsquo;s daughter, she suited her surroundings
with the best grace imaginable; and whatever she
said seemed so pat and pretty that Will conceived a great
idea of her talents. He could see her face, as she leaned
forward, against a background of rising pine-woods; her
eyes shone peaceably; the light lay around her hair like a
kerchief; something that was hardly a smile rippled her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
pale cheeks, and Will could not contain himself from gazing
on her in an agreeable dismay. She looked, even in her
quietest moments, so complete in herself, and so quick with
life down to her finger-tips and the very skirts of her dress,
that the remainder of created things became no more than a
blot by comparison; and if Will glanced away from her to
her surroundings, the trees looked inanimate and senseless,
the clouds hung in heaven like dead things, and even the
mountain tops were disenchanted. The whole valley could
not compare in looks with this one girl.</p>

<p>Will was always observant in the society of his fellow-creatures;
but his observation became almost painfully
eager in the case of Marjory. He listened to all she uttered,
and read her eyes, at the same time, for the unspoken commentary.
Many kind, simple, and sincere speeches found
an echo in his heart. He became conscious of a soul beautifully
poised upon itself, nothing doubting, nothing desiring,
clothed in peace. It was not possible to separate her thoughts
from her appearance. The turn of her wrist, the still sound
of her voice, the light in her eyes, the lines of her body, fell
in tune with her grave and gentle words, like the accompaniment
that sustains and harmonises the voice of the singer.
Her influence was one thing, not to be divided or discussed,
only to be felt with gratitude and joy. To Will, her presence
recalled something of his childhood, and the thought
of her took its place in his mind beside that of dawn, of running
water, and of the earliest violets and lilacs. It is the
property of things seen for the first time, or for the first time
after long, like the flowers in spring, to reawaken in us the
sharp edge of sense and that impression of mystic strangeness
which otherwise passes out of life with the coming of
years; but the sight of a loved face is what renews a man&rsquo;s
character from the fountain upwards.</p>

<p>One day after dinner Will took a stroll among the firs;
a grave beatitude possessed him from top to toe, and he
kept smiling to himself and the landscape as he went. The
river ran between the stepping-stones with a pretty wimple;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
a bird sang loudly in the wood; the hill-tops looked immeasurably
high, and, as he glanced at them from time to time,
seemed to contemplate his movements with a beneficent
but awful curiosity. His way took him to the eminence
which overlooked the plain; and there he sat down upon a
stone, and fell into deep and pleasant thought. The plain
lay abroad with its cities and silver river; everything was
asleep, except a great eddy of birds which kept rising and
falling and going round and round in the blue air. He
repeated Marjory&rsquo;s name aloud, and the sound of it gratified
his ear. He shut his eyes, and her image sprang up before
him, quietly luminous and attended with good thoughts.
The river might run for ever; the birds fly higher and
higher till they touched the stars. He saw it was empty
bustle after all; for here, without stirring a foot, waiting
patiently in his own narrow valley, he also had attained
the better sunlight.</p>

<p>The next day Will made a sort of declaration across the
dinner-table, while the parson was filling his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Marjory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never knew any one I liked
so well as you. I am mostly a cold, unkindly sort of man;
not from want of heart, but out of strangeness in my way
of thinking; and people seem far away from me. &rsquo;Tis as if
there were a circle round me, which kept every one out but
you; I can hear the others talking and laughing; but you
come quite close.&mdash;Maybe this is disagreeable to you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>Marjory made no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak up, girl,&rdquo; said the parson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, now,&rdquo; returned Will, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t press her,
parson. I feel tongue-tied myself, who am not used to it;
and she&rsquo;s a woman, and little more than a child, when all is
said. But for my part, as far as I can understand what
people mean by it, I fancy I must be what they call in
love. I do not wish to be held as committing myself;
for I may be wrong; but that is how I believe things
are with me. And if Miss Marjory should feel any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
otherwise on her part, mayhap she would be so kind as
shake her head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marjory was silent, and gave no sign that she had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that, parson?&rdquo; asked Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl must speak,&rdquo; replied the parson, laying down
his pipe.&mdash;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our neighbour, who says he loves you,
Madge. Do you love him, ay or no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; said Marjory faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, that&rsquo;s all that could be wished!&rdquo; cried Will
heartily. And he took her hand across the table and held it
a moment in both of his with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must marry,&rdquo; observed the parson, replacing his
pipe in his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the right thing to do, think you?&rdquo; demanded
Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is indispensable,&rdquo; said the parson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the wooer.</p>

<p>Two or three days passed away with great delight to
Will, although a bystander might scarce have found it out.
He continued to take his meals opposite Marjory, and to
talk with her and gaze upon her in her father&rsquo;s presence;
but he made no attempt to see her alone, nor in any other
way changed his conduct towards her from what it had been
since the beginning. Perhaps the girl was a little disappointed,
and perhaps not unjustly; and yet if it had been
enough to be always in the thoughts of another person,
and so pervade and alter his whole life, she might have
been thoroughly contented. For she was never out of Will&rsquo;s
mind for an instant. He sat over the stream, and watched
the dust of the eddy, and the poised fish, and straining
weeds; he wandered out alone into the purple even, with all
the blackbirds piping round him in the wood; he rose early
in the morning, and saw the sky turn from grey to gold,
and the light leap upon the hill-tops; and all the while he
kept wondering if he had never seen such things before, or
how it was that they should look so different now. The
sound of his own mill-wheel, or of the wind among the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
confounded and charmed his heart. The most enchanting
thoughts presented themselves unbidden in his mind. He
was so happy that he could not sleep at night, and so restless
that he could hardly sit still out of her company. And
yet it seemed as if he avoided her rather than sought her
out.</p>

<p>One day, as he was coming home from a ramble, Will
found Marjory in the garden picking flowers, and, as he
came up with her, slackened his pace and continued walking
by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like flowers?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I love them dearly,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not so much. They are a very
small affair when all is done. I can fancy people caring for
them greatly, but not doing as you are just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she asked, pausing and looking up at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plucking them,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They are a deal better
off where they are, and look a deal prettier, if you go to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to have them for my own,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;to
carry them near my heart, and keep them in my room.
They tempt me when they grow here; they seem to say,
&lsquo;Come and do something with us&rsquo;; but once I have cut
them and put them by, the charm is laid, and I can look at
them with quite an easy heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to possess them,&rdquo; replied Will, &ldquo;in order
to think no more about them. It&rsquo;s a bit like killing the
goose with the golden eggs. It&rsquo;s a bit like what I wished to
do when I was a boy. Because I had a fancy for looking
out over the plain, I wished to go down there&mdash;where I
couldn&rsquo;t look out over it any longer. Was not that fine
reasoning? Dear, dear, if they only thought of it, all the
world would do like me; and you would let your flowers
alone, just as I stay up here in the mountains.&rdquo; Suddenly
he broke off sharp. &ldquo;By the Lord!&rdquo; he cried. And when
she asked him what was wrong, he turned the question off,
and walked away into the house with rather a humorous
expression of face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>He was silent at table; and after the night had fallen
and the stars had come out overhead, he walked up and
down for hours in the courtyard and garden with an uneven
pace. There was still a light in the window of Marjory&rsquo;s
room: one little oblong patch of orange in a world of dark
blue hills and silver starlight. Will&rsquo;s mind ran a great deal
on the window; but his thoughts were not very lover-like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is in her room,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and there are the
stars overhead:&mdash;a blessing upon both!&rdquo; Both were good
influences in his life; both soothed and braced him in his
profound contentment with the world. And what more
should he desire with either? The fat young man and his
counsels were so present to his mind that he threw back his
head and, putting his hands before his mouth, shouted
aloud to the populous heavens. Whether from the position
of his head or the sudden strain of the exertion, he seemed
to see a momentary shock among the stars, and a diffusion
of frosty light pass from one to another along the sky. At
the same instant, a corner of the blind was lifted and lowered
again at once. He laughed a loud ho-ho! &ldquo;One and
another!&rdquo; thought Will. &ldquo;The stars tremble, and the
blind goes up. Why, before Heaven, what a great magician
I must be! Now if I were only a fool, should not I be in a
pretty way?&rdquo; And he went off to bed, chuckling to himself:
&ldquo;If I were only a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning, pretty early, he saw her once more in
the garden, and sought her out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about getting married,&rdquo; he began
abruptly; &ldquo;and after having turned it all over, I have made
up my mind it&rsquo;s not worth while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned upon him for a single moment; but his
radiant, kindly appearance would, under the circumstances,
have disconcerted an angel, and she looked down again upon
the ground in silence. He could see her tremble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he went on, a little taken
aback. &ldquo;You ought not. I have turned it all over, and
upon my soul there&rsquo;s nothing in it. We should never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
one whit nearer than we are just now, and, if I am a wise
man, nothing like so happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is unnecessary to go round about with me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I very well remember that you refused to commit yourself;
and now that I see you were mistaken, and in reality have
never cared for me, I can only feel sad that I have been so
far misled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask your pardon,&rdquo; said Will stoutly; &ldquo;you do not
understand my meaning. As to whether I have ever loved
you or not, I must leave that to others. But for one thing,
my feeling is not changed; and for another, you may make
it your boast that you have made my whole life and character
something different from what they were. I mean
what I say; no less. I do not think getting married is
worth while. I would rather you went on living with your
father, so that I could walk over and see you once, or maybe
twice a week, as people go to church, and then we should
both be all the happier between whiles. That&rsquo;s my notion.
But I&rsquo;ll marry you if you will,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that you are insulting me?&rdquo; she broke
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I, Marjory,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;if there is anything in a
clear conscience, not I. I offer all my heart&rsquo;s best affection;
you can take it or want it, though I suspect it&rsquo;s beyond
either your power or mine to change what has once been
done, and set me fancy-free. I&rsquo;ll marry you, if you like;
but I tell you again and again, it&rsquo;s not worth while, and we
had best stay friends. Though I am a quiet man, I have
noticed a heap of things in my life. Trust in me, and take
things as I propose; or, if you don&rsquo;t like that, say the word,
and I&rsquo;ll marry you out of hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a considerable pause, and Will, who began to
feel uneasy, began to grow angry in consequence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems you are too proud to say your mind,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Believe me that&rsquo;s a pity. A clean shrift makes simple
living. Can a man be more downright or honourable to a
woman than I have been? I have said my say, and given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
you your choice. Do you want me to marry you? or will
you take my friendship, as I think best? or have you had
enough of me for good? Speak out for the dear God&rsquo;s sake!
You know your father told you a girl should speak her mind
in these affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed to recover herself at that, turned without a
word, walked rapidly through the garden, and disappeared
into the house, leaving Will in some confusion as to the
result. He walked up and down the garden, whistling softly
to himself. Sometimes he stopped and contemplated the
sky and hill-tops; sometimes he went down to the tail of the
weir and sat there, looking foolishly in the water. All this
dubiety and perturbation was so foreign to his nature and
the life which he had resolutely chosen for himself, that he
began to regret Marjory&rsquo;s arrival. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;I was as happy as a man need be. I could come down here
and watch my fishes all day long if I wanted: I was as settled
and contented as my old mill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marjory came down to dinner, looking very trim and
quiet; and no sooner were all three at table than she made
her father a speech, with her eyes fixed upon her plate, but
showing no other sign of embarrassment or distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;Mr. Will and I have been talking
things over. We see that we have each made a mistake
about our feelings, and he has agreed, at my request, to give
up all idea of marriage, and be no more than my very good
friend, as in the past. You see, there is no shadow of a
quarrel, and indeed I hope we shall see a great deal of him in
the future, for his visits will always be welcome in our house.
Of course, father, you will know best, but perhaps we should
do better to leave Mr. Will&rsquo;s house for the present. I believe,
after what has passed, we should hardly be agreeable
inmates for some days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will, who had commanded himself with difficulty from the
first, broke out upon this into an inarticulate noise, and raised
one hand with an appearance of real dismay, as if he were
about to interfere and contradict. But she checked him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
once, looking up at him with a swift glance and an angry
flush upon her cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will perhaps have the good grace,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
let me explain these matters for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will was put entirely out of countenance by her
expression and the ring of her voice. He held his peace,
concluding that there were some things about this
girl beyond his comprehension&mdash;in which he was exactly
right.</p>

<p>The poor parson was quite crestfallen. He tried to
prove that this was no more than a true lovers&rsquo; tiff, which
would pass off before night; and when he was dislodged from
that position, he went on to argue that where there was no
quarrel there could be no call for a separation; for the good
man liked both his entertainment and his host. It was
curious to see how the girl managed them, saying little all
the time, and that very quietly, and yet twisting them
round her finger and insensibly leading them wherever she
would by feminine tact and generalship. It scarcely seemed
to have been her doing&mdash;it seemed as if things had merely
so fallen out&mdash;that she and her father took their departure
that same afternoon in a farm-cart, and went farther down
the valley, to wait, until their own house was ready for them,
in another hamlet. But Will had been observing closely,
and was well aware of her dexterity and resolution. When
he found himself alone he had a great many curious matters
to turn over in his mind. He was very sad and solitary, to
begin with. All the interest had gone out of his life, and he
might look up at the stars as long as he pleased, he somehow
failed to find support or consolation. And then he was in
such a turmoil of spirit about Marjory. He had been
puzzled and irritated at her behaviour, and yet he could not
keep himself from admiring it. He thought he recognised
a fine, perverse angel in that still soul which he had never
hitherto suspected; and though he saw it was an influence
that would fit but ill with his own life of artificial calm, he
could not keep himself from ardently desiring to possess it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Like a man who has lived among shadows and now meets
the sun, he was both pained and delighted.</p>

<p>As the days went forward he passed from one extreme
to another; now pluming himself on the strength of his
determination, now despising his timid and silly caution.
The former was, perhaps, the true thought of his heart, and
represented the regular tenor of the man&rsquo;s reflections; but
the latter burst forth from time to time with an unruly
violence, and then he would forget all consideration, and go
up and down his house and garden or walk among the fir-woods
like one who is beside himself with remorse. To
equable, steady-minded Will, this state of matters was
intolerable; and he determined, at whatever cost, to bring
it to an end. So, one warm summer afternoon, he put on
his best clothes, took a thorn switch in his hand, and set out
down the valley by the river. As soon as he had taken his
determination, he had regained at a bound his customary
peace of heart, and he enjoyed the bright weather and the
variety of the scene without any admixture of alarm or unpleasant
eagerness. It was nearly the same to him how the
matter turned out. If she accepted him he would have to
marry her this time, which perhaps was all for the best. If
she refused him, he would have done his utmost, and might
follow his own way in the future with an untroubled conscience.
He hoped, on the whole, she would refuse him;
and then, again, as he saw the brown roof which sheltered
her, peeping through some willows at an angle of the stream,
he was half inclined to reverse the wish, and more than half-ashamed
of himself for this infirmity of purpose.</p>

<p>Marjory seemed glad to see him, and gave him her hand
without affectation or delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about this marriage,&rdquo; he
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And I respect you more
and more for a very wise man. You understood me better
than I understood myself; and I am now quite certain that
things are all for the best as they are.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;At the same time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; ventured Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be tired,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Take a seat
and let me fetch you a glass of wine. The afternoon is so
warm; and I wish you not to be displeased with your visit.
You must come quite often; once a week, if you can spare
the time; I am always so glad to see my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; thought Will to himself. &ldquo;It appears
I was right after all.&rdquo; And he paid a very agreeable visit,
walked home again in capital spirits, and gave himself no
further concern about the matter.</p>

<p>For nearly three years Will and Marjory continued on
these terms, seeing each other once or twice a week without
any word of love between them; and for all that time I
believe Will was nearly as happy as a man can be. He rather
stinted himself the pleasure of seeing her; and he would
often walk half-way over to the parsonage, and then back
again, as if to whet his appetite. Indeed, there was one
corner of the road, whence he could see the church-spire
wedged into a crevice of the valley between sloping fir-woods,
with a triangular snatch of plain by way of background,
which he greatly affected as a place to sit and
moralise in before returning homewards; and the peasants
got so much into the habit of finding him there in the twilight
that they gave it the name of &ldquo;Will o&rsquo; the Mill&rsquo;s Corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of the three years Marjory played him a sad
trick by suddenly marrying somebody else. Will kept his
countenance bravely, and merely remarked that, for as
little as he knew of women, he had acted very prudently in
not marrying her himself three years before. She plainly
knew very little of her own mind, and, in spite of a deceptive
manner, was as fickle and flighty as the rest of them. He
had to congratulate himself on an escape, he said, and would
take a higher opinion of his own wisdom in consequence.
But at heart he was reasonably displeased, moped a good
deal for a month or two, and fell away in flesh, to the astonishment
of his serving-lads.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a year after this marriage that Will was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
awakened late one night by the sound of a horse galloping
on the road, followed by precipitate knocking at the inn-door.
He opened his window and saw a farm-servant,
mounted and holding a led horse by the bridle, who told
him to make what haste he could and go along with him;
for Marjory was dying, and had sent urgently to fetch him
to her bedside. Will was no horseman, and made so little
speed upon the way that the poor young wife was very
near her end before he arrived. But they had some minutes&rsquo;
talk in private, and he was present and wept very bitterly
while she breathed her last.</p>

<div style="padding-top: 2em; ">&nbsp;</div>
<hr class="art" />
<h3>DEATH</h3>

<p>Year after year went away into nothing, with great
explosions and outcries in the cities on the plain: red revolt
springing up and being suppressed in blood, battle swaying
hither and thither, patient astronomers in observatory
towers picking out and christening new stars, plays being
performed in lighted theatres, people being carried into
hospital on stretchers, and all the usual turmoil and agitation
of men&rsquo;s lives in crowded centres. Up in Will&rsquo;s valley only
the winds and seasons made an epoch; the fish hung in the
swift stream, the birds circled overhead, the pine-tops
rustled underneath the stars, the tall hills stood over all;
and Will went to and fro, minding his wayside inn, until
the snow began to thicken on his head. His heart was
young and vigorous; and if his pulses kept a sober time,
they still beat strong and steady in his wrists. He carried
a ruddy stain on either cheek, like a ripe apple; he stooped
a little, but his step was still firm; and his sinewy hands
were reached out to all men with a friendly pressure. His
face was covered with those wrinkles which are got in open
air, and which, rightly looked at, are no more than a sort
of permanent sunburning; such wrinkles heighten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
stupidity of stupid faces; but to a person like Will, with his
clear eyes and smiling mouth, only give another charm by
testifying to a simple and easy life. His talk was full of
wise sayings. He had a taste for other people; and other
people had a taste for him. When the valley was full of
tourists in the season, there were merry nights in Will&rsquo;s
arbour; and his views, which seemed whimsical to his
neighbours, were often enough admired by learned people
out of towns and colleges. Indeed, he had a very noble
old age, and grew daily better known; so that his fame was
heard of in the cities of the plain; and young men who had
been summer travellers spoke together in caf&eacute;s of Will o&rsquo;
the Mill and his rough philosophy. Many and many an
invitation, you may be sure, he had; but nothing could
tempt him from his upland valley. He would shake his
head and smile over his tobacco-pipe with a deal of meaning.
&ldquo;You come too late,&rdquo; he would answer. &ldquo;I am a dead
man now: I have lived and died already. Fifty years ago
you would have brought my heart into my mouth; and now
you do not even tempt me. But that is the object of long
living, that man should cease to care about life.&rdquo; And
again: &ldquo;There is only one difference between a long life
and a good dinner: that, in the dinner, the sweets come
last.&rdquo; Or once more: &ldquo;When I was a boy I was a bit
puzzled, and hardly knew whether it was myself or the
world that was curious and worth looking into. Now, I
know it is myself, and stick to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He never showed any symptom of frailty, but kept
stalwart and firm to the last; but they say he grew less
talkative towards the end, and would listen to other people
by the hour in an amused and sympathetic silence. Only,
when he did speak, it was more to the point and more
charged with old experience. He drank a bottle of wine
gladly; above all, at sunset on the hill-top or quite late at
night under the stars in the arbour. The sight of something
attractive and unattainable seasoned his enjoyment, he
would say; and he professed he had lived long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
admire a candle all the more when he could compare it with
a planet.</p>

<p>One night, in his seventy-second year, he awoke in bed
in such uneasiness of body and mind that he arose and
dressed himself and went out to meditate in the arbour.
It was pitch dark, without a star; the river was swollen,
and the wet woods and meadows loaded the air with perfume.
It had thundered during the day, and it promised
more thunder for the morrow. A murky, stifling night for
a man of seventy-two! Whether it was the weather or
the wakefulness, or some little touch of fever in his old
limbs, Will&rsquo;s mind was besieged by tumultuous and crying
memories. His boyhood, the night with the fat young man,
the death of his adopted parents, the summer days with
Marjory, and many of those small circumstances, which
seem nothing to another, and are yet the very gist of a man&rsquo;s
own life to himself&mdash;things seen, words heard, looks misconstrued&mdash;arose
from their forgotten corners and usurped
his attention. The dead themselves were with him, not
merely taking part in this thin show of memory that defiled
before his brain, but revisiting his bodily senses as they do
in profound and vivid dreams.  The fat young man
leaned his elbows on the table opposite; Marjory came and
went with an apronful of flowers between the garden and
the arbour; he could hear the old parson knocking out his
pipe or blowing his resonant nose. The tide of his consciousness
ebbed and flowed: he was sometimes half-asleep
and drowned in his recollections of the past: and sometimes
he was broad awake, wondering at himself. But about the
middle of the night he was startled by the voice of the dead
miller calling to him out of the house as he used to do on
the arrival of custom. The hallucination was so perfect
that Will sprang from his seat and stood listening for the
summons to be repeated; and as he listened he became
conscious of another noise besides the brawling of the river
and the ringing in his feverish ears. It was like the stir of
horses and the creaking of harness, as though a carriage with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
an impatient team had been brought up upon the road before
the courtyard gate. At such an hour, upon this rough
and dangerous pass, the supposition was no better than
absurd; and Will dismissed it from his mind, and resumed
his seat upon the arbour chair; and sleep closed over him
again like running water. He was once again awakened by
the dead miller&rsquo;s call, thinner and more spectral than before;
and once again he heard the noise of an equipage upon the
road. And so thrice and four times, the same dream, or
the same fancy, presented itself to his senses: until at
length, smiling to himself as when one humours a nervous
child, he proceeded towards the gate to set his uncertainty
at rest.</p>

<p>From the arbour to the gate was no great distance, and
yet it took Will some time; it seemed as if the dead thickened
around him in the court, and crossed his path at every step.
For, first, he was suddenly surprised by an overpowering
sweetness of heliotropes; it was as if his garden had been
planted with this flower from end to end, and the hot,
damp night had drawn forth all their perfumes in a breath.
Now the heliotrope had been Marjory&rsquo;s favourite flower,
and since her death not one of them had ever been planted
in Will&rsquo;s ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going crazy,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Poor Marjory
and her heliotropes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he raised his eyes towards the window
that had once been hers. If he had been bewildered before,
he was now almost terrified; for there was a light in the
room; the window was an orange oblong as of yore; and
the corner of the blind was lifted and let fall as on the night
when he stood and shouted to the stars in his perplexity.
The illusion only endured an instant; but it left him somewhat
unmanned, rubbing his eyes and staring at the outline
of the house and the black night behind it. While he thus
stood, and it seemed as if he must have stood there quite
a long time, there came a renewal of the noises on the road:
and he turned in time to meet a stranger, who was advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
to meet him across the court. There was something like
the outline of a great carriage discernible on the road behind
the stranger, and, above that, a few black pine-tops, like
so many plumes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Will?&rdquo; asked the new-comer, in brief military
fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That same, sir,&rdquo; answered Will. &ldquo;Can I do anything
to serve you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard you much spoken of, Master Will,&rdquo; returned
the other; &ldquo;much spoken of, and well. And though
I have both hands full of business, I wish to drink a bottle
of wine with you in your arbour. Before I go, I shall introduce
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will led the way to the trellis, and got a lamp lighted
and a bottle uncorked. He was not altogether unused to
such complimentary interviews, and hoped little enough
from this one, being schooled by many disappointments.
A sort of cloud had settled on his wits and prevented him
from remembering the strangeness of the hour. He moved
like a person in his sleep; and it seemed as if the lamp
caught fire and the bottle came uncorked with the facility
of thought. Still, he had some curiosity about the appearance
of his visitor, and tried in vain to turn the light into his
face; either he handled the lamp clumsily, or there was a
dimness over his eyes; but he could make out little more
than a shadow at table with him. He stared and stared at
this shadow, as he wiped out the glasses, and began to feel
cold and strange about the heart. The silence weighed
upon him, for he could hear nothing now, not even the river,
but the drumming of his own arteries in his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to you,&rdquo; said the stranger roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is my service, sir,&rdquo; replied Will, sipping his wine,
which somehow tasted oddly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you are a very positive fellow,&rdquo; pursued
the stranger.</p>

<p>Will made answer with a smile of some satisfaction and a
little nod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; continued the other; &ldquo;and it is the delight
of my heart to tramp on people&rsquo;s corns. I will have nobody
positive but myself; not one. I have crossed the
whims, in my time, of kings and generals and great artists.
And what would you say,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if I had come up
here on purpose to cross yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will had it on his tongue to make a sharp rejoinder;
but the politeness of an old innkeeper prevailed; and he
held his peace and made answer with a civil gesture of the
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;And if I did not hold
you in a particular esteem, I should make no words about
the matter. It appears you pride yourself on staying where
you are. You mean to stick by your inn. Now I mean
you shall come for a turn with me in my barouche; and
before this bottle&rsquo;s empty, so you shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be an odd thing, to be sure,&rdquo; replied Will,
with a chuckle. &ldquo;Why, sir, I have grown here like an old
oak-tree; the devil himself could hardly root me up: and
for all I perceive you are a very entertaining old gentleman,
I would wager you another bottle you lose your pains with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dimness of Will&rsquo;s eyesight had been increasing all
this while; but he was somehow conscious of a sharp and
chilling scrutiny which irritated and yet overmastered
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not think,&rdquo; he broke out suddenly, in an explosive,
febrile manner that startled and alarmed himself,
&ldquo;that I am a stay-at-home because I fear anything under
God. God knows I am tired enough of it all; and when
the time comes for a longer journey than ever you dream of,
I reckon I shall find myself prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger emptied his glass and pushed it away from
him. He looked down for a little, and then, leaning over
the table, tapped Will three times upon the forearm with a
single finger. &ldquo;The time has come!&rdquo; he said solemnly.</p>

<p>An ugly thrill spread from the spot he touched. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
tones of his voice were dull and startling, and echoed strangely
in Will&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, with some discomposure.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at me, and you will find your eyesight swim.
Raise your hand; it is dead-heavy. This is your last
bottle of wine, Master Will, and your last night upon the
earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a doctor?&rdquo; quavered Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best that ever was,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;for
I cure both mind and body with the same prescription. I
take away all pain and I forgive all sins; and where my
patients have gone wrong in life, I smooth out all complications
and set them free again upon their feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no need of you,&rdquo; said Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A time comes for all men, Master Will,&rdquo; replied the
doctor, &ldquo;when the helm is taken out of their hands. For
you, because you were prudent and quiet, it has been long
of coming, and you have had long to discipline yourself for
its reception. You have seen what is to be seen about your
mill; you have sat close all your days like a hare in its form;
but now that is at an end; and,&rdquo; added the doctor, getting
on his feet, &ldquo;you must arise and come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a strange physician,&rdquo; said Will, looking steadfastly
upon his guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a natural law,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and people call me
Death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not tell me so at first?&rdquo; cried Will. &ldquo;I
have been waiting for you these many years. Give me your
hand, and welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lean upon my arm,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;for already
your strength abates. Lean on me as heavily as you need;
for though I am old, I am very strong. It is but three steps
to my carriage, and there all your trouble ends. Why, Will,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;I have been yearning for you as if you were my
own son; and of all the men that ever I came for in my long
days, I have come for you most gladly. I am caustic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
sometimes offend people at first sight; but I am a good
friend at heart to such as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since Marjory was taken,&rdquo; returned Will, &ldquo;I declare
before God you were the only friend I had to look for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the pair went arm-in-arm across the courtyard.</p>

<p>One of the servants awoke about this time and heard
the noise of horses pawing before he dropped asleep again;
all down the valley that night there was a rushing as of a
smooth and steady wind descending towards the plain; and
when the world rose next morning, sure enough Will o&rsquo; the
Mill had gone at last upon his travels.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>BY THE DYING MOUNTEBANK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">They</span> had sent for the doctor from Bourron before six.
About eight some villagers came round for the performance,
and were told how matters stood. It seemed a liberty for a
mountebank to fall ill like real people, and they made off
again in dudgeon. By ten Madame Tentaillon was gravely
alarmed, and had sent down the street for Doctor Desprez.</p>

<p>The Doctor was at work over his manuscripts in one
corner of the little dining-room, and his wife was asleep over
the fire in another, when the messenger arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sapristi!</i>&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;you should have sent
for me before. It was a case for hurry.&rdquo; And he followed
the messenger as he was, in his slippers and skull-cap.</p>

<p>The inn was not thirty yards away, but the messenger
did not stop there; he went in at one door and out by
another into the court, and then led the way, by a flight of
steps beside the stable, to the loft where the mountebank
lay sick. If Doctor Desprez were to live a thousand years,
he would never forget his arrival in that room; for not only
was the scene picturesque, but the moment made a date in
his existence. We reckon our lives, I hardly know why, from
the date of our first sorry appearance in society, as if from
a first humiliation; for no actor can come upon the stage
with a worse grace. Not to go further back, which would
be judged too curious, there are subsequently many moving
and decisive accidents in the lives of all, which would make
as logical a period as this of birth. And here, for instance,
Doctor Desprez, a man past forty, who had made what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
called a failure in life, and was moreover married, found himself
at a new point of departure when he opened the door of
the loft above Tentaillon&rsquo;s stable.</p>

<p>It was a large place, lighted only by a single candle set
upon the floor. The mountebank lay on his back upon a
pallet; a large man with a Quixotic nose inflamed with
drinking. Madame Tentaillon stooped over him, applying
a hot water and mustard embrocation to his feet; and on a
chair close by sat a little fellow of eleven or twelve, with his
feet dangling. These three were the only occupants except
the shadows. But the shadows were a company in themselves;
the extent of the room exaggerated them to a gigantic
size, and from the low position of the candle the light struck
upwards and produced deformed foreshortenings. The
mountebank&rsquo;s profile was enlarged upon the wall in caricature,
and it was strange to see his nose shorten and lengthen
as the flame was blown about by draughts. As for Madame
Tentaillon, her shadow was no more than a gross hump of
shoulders, with now and again a hemisphere of head.
The chair-legs were spindled out as long as stilts, and the
boy sat perched a-top of them, like a cloud, in the corner of
the roof.</p>

<p>It was the boy who took the Doctor&rsquo;s fancy. He had a
great arched skull, the forehead and the hands of a musician,
and a pair of haunting eyes. It was not merely that these
eyes were large, or steady, or the softest ruddy brown.
There was a look in them, besides, which thrilled the Doctor,
and made him half uneasy. He was sure he had seen such
a look before, and yet he could not remember how or where.
It was as if this boy, who was quite a stranger to him, had
the eyes of an old friend or an old enemy. And the boy would
give him no peace; he seemed profoundly indifferent to
what was going on, or rather abstracted from it in a superior
contemplation, beating gently with his feet against the bars
of the chair, and holding his hands folded on his lap. But,
for all that, his eyes kept following the Doctor about the
room with a thoughtful fixity of gaze. Desprez could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
tell whether he was fascinating the boy, or the boy was
fascinating him. He busied himself over the sick man, he
put questions, he felt the pulse, he jested, he grew a little hot
and swore: and still, whenever he looked round, there were
the brown eyes waiting for his with the same inquiring,
melancholy gaze.</p>

<p>At last the Doctor hit on the solution at a leap. He
remembered the look now. The little fellow, although he
was as straight as a dart, had the eyes that go usually with a
crooked back; he was not at all deformed, and yet a deformed
person seemed to be looking at you from below his
brows. The Doctor drew a long breath, he was so much
relieved to find a theory (for he loved theories) and to
explain away his interest.</p>

<p>For all that, he despatched the invalid with unusual
haste, and, still kneeling with one knee on the floor, turned
a little round and looked the boy over at his leisure. The
boy was not in the least put out, but looked placidly back
at the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your father?&rdquo; asked Desprez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; returned the boy; &ldquo;my master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you fond of him?&rdquo; continued the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>Madame Tentaillon and Desprez exchanged expressive
glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is bad, my man,&rdquo; resumed the latter, with a
shade of sternness. &ldquo;Every one should be fond of the
dying, or conceal their sentiments; and your master here is
dying. If I have watched a bird a little while stealing my
cherries, I have a thought of disappointment when he flies
away over my garden wall, and I see him steer for the forest
and vanish. How much more a creature such as this, so
strong, so astute, so richly endowed with faculties! When
I think that, in a few hours, the speech will be silenced, the
breath extinct, and even the shadow vanished from the wall,
I who never saw him, this lady who knew him only as a
guest, are touched with some affection.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>The boy was silent for a little, and appeared to be reflecting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not know him,&rdquo; he replied at last. &ldquo;He was
a bad man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a little pagan,&rdquo; said the landlady. &ldquo;For that
matter, they are all the same, these mountebanks, tumblers,
artists, and what not. They have no interior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Doctor was still scrutinising the little pagan, his
eyebrows knotted and uplifted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean-Marie,&rdquo; said the lad.</p>

<p>Desprez leaped upon him with one of his sudden flashes of
excitement, and felt his head all over from an ethnological
point of view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Celtic, Celtic!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Celtic!&rdquo; cried Madame Tentaillon, who had perhaps
confounded the word with hydrocephalous. &ldquo;Poor lad! is
it dangerous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; returned the Doctor grimly. And
then once more addressing the boy: &ldquo;And what do you do
for your living, Jean-Marie?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tumble,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! Tumble?&rdquo; repeated Desprez. &ldquo;Probably
healthful. I hazard the guess, Madame Tentaillon, that
tumbling is a healthful way of life. And have you never
done anything else but tumble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I learned that, I used to steal,&rdquo; answered Jean-Marie
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;You are a nice
little man for your age.&mdash;Madame, when my <i>confr&egrave;re</i> comes
from Bourron, you will communicate my unfavourable
opinion. I leave the case in his hands; but of course, on
any alarming symptom, above all if there should be a sign
of rally, do not hesitate to knock me up. I am a doctor no
longer, I thank God; but I have been one. Good-night,
madame.&mdash;Good sleep to you, Jean-Marie.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>MORNING TALK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Doctor</span> Desprez always rose early. Before the smoke
arose, before the first cart rattled over the bridge to the
day&rsquo;s labour in the fields, he was to be found wandering in
his garden. Now he would pick a bunch of grapes; now he
would eat a big pear under the trellis; now he would draw
all sorts of fancies on the path with the end of his cane; now
he would go down and watch the river running endlessly past
the timber landing-place at which he moored his boat.
There was no time, he used to say, for making theories like
the early morning. &ldquo;I rise earlier than any one else in the
village,&rdquo; he once boasted. &ldquo;It is a fair consequence that I
know more and wish to do less with my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor was a connoisseur of sunrises, and loved a
good theatrical effect to usher in the day. He had a theory
of dew, by which he could predict the weather. Indeed,
most things served him to that end: the sound of the bells
from all the neighbouring villages, the smell of the forest,
the visits and the behaviour of both birds and fishes, the
look of the plants in his garden, the disposition of cloud,
the colour of the light, and last, although not least, the
arsenal of meteorological instruments in a louvre-boarded
hutch upon the lawn. Ever since he had settled at Gretz,
he had been growing more and more into the local meteorologist,
the unpaid champion of the local climate. He
thought at first there was no place so healthful in the arrondissement.
By the end of the second year, he protested
there was none so wholesome in the whole department.
And for some time before he met Jean-Marie he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
prepared to challenge all France and the better part of
Europe for a rival to his chosen spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he would say&mdash;&ldquo;doctor is a foul word. It
should not be used to ladies. It implies disease. I remark
it, as a flaw in our civilisation, that we have not the proper
horror of disease. Now I, for my part, have washed my
hands of it; I have renounced my laureation; I am no
doctor; I am only a worshipper of the true goddess Hygieia.
Ah! believe me, it is she who has the cestus! And here, in
this exiguous hamlet, has she placed her shrine: here she
dwells and lavishes her gifts; here I walk with her in the
early morning, and she shows me how strong she has made
the peasants, how fruitful she has made the fields, how the
trees grow up tall and comely under her eyes, and the fishes
in the river become clean and agile at her presence.&mdash;Rheumatism!&rdquo;
he would cry, on some malapert interruption,
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I believe we do have a little rheumatism.
That could hardly be avoided, you know, on a river. And
of course the place stands a little low; and the meadows are
marshy, there&rsquo;s no doubt. But, my dear sir, look at
Bourron! Bourron stands high. Bourron is close to the
forest; plenty of ozone there, you would say. Well, compared
with Gretz, Bourron is a perfect shambles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning after he had been summoned to the dying
mountebank, the Doctor visited the wharf at the tail of his
garden, and had a long look at the running water. This he
called prayer; but whether his adorations were addressed
to the goddess Hygieia or some more orthodox deity, never
plainly appeared. For he had uttered doubtful oracles,
sometimes declaring that a river was the type of bodily
health, sometimes extolling it as the great moral preacher,
continually preaching peace, continuity, and diligence to
man&rsquo;s tormented spirits. After he had watched a mile or so
of the clear water running by before his eyes, seen a fish or
two come to the surface with a gleam of silver, and sufficiently
admired the long shadows of the trees falling half
across the river from the opposite bank, with patches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
moving sunlight in between, he strolled once more up the
garden and through his house into the street, feeling cool
and renovated.</p>

<p>The sound of his feet upon the causeway began the
business of the day; for the village was still sound asleep.
The church tower looked very airy in the sunlight; a few
birds that turned about it seemed to swim in an atmosphere
of more than usual rarity; and the Doctor, walking in long
transparent shadows, filled his lungs amply, and proclaimed
himself well contented with the morning.</p>

<p>On one of the posts before Tentaillon&rsquo;s carriage entry
he espied a little dark figure perched in a meditative attitude,
and immediately recognised Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he said, stopping before him humorously, with
a hand on either knee. &ldquo;So we rise early in the morning,
do we? It appears to me that we have all the vices of a
philosopher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy got to his feet and made a grave salutation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is our patient?&rdquo; asked Desprez.</p>

<p>It appeared the patient was about the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why do you rise early in the morning?&rdquo; he
pursued.</p>

<p>Jean-Marie, after a long silence, professed that he hardly
knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hardly know?&rdquo; repeated Desprez. &ldquo;We hardly
know anything, my man, until we try to learn. Interrogate
your consciousness. Come, push me this inquiry home.
Do you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy slowly; &ldquo;yes, I like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why do you like it?&rdquo; continued the Doctor.
&ldquo;(We are now pursuing the Socratic method.) Why do you
like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quiet,&rdquo; answered Jean-Marie; &ldquo;and I have
nothing to do; and then I feel as if I were good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Desprez took a seat on the post at the opposite
side. He was beginning to take an interest in the talk, for
the boy plainly thought before he spoke, and tried to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
truly. &ldquo;It appears you have a taste for feeling good,&rdquo; said
the Doctor. &ldquo;Now, there you puzzle me extremely; for I
thought you said you were a thief; and the two are incompatible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it very bad to steal?&rdquo; asked Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such is the general opinion, little boy,&rdquo; replied the
Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I mean as I stole,&rdquo; explained the other.
&ldquo;For I had no choice. I think it is surely right to have
bread; it must be right to have bread, there comes so plain
a want of it. And then they beat me cruelly if I returned
with nothing,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I was not ignorant of right and
wrong; for before that I had been well taught by a priest,
who was very kind to me.&rdquo; (The Doctor made a horrible
grimace at the word &ldquo;priest.&rdquo;) &ldquo;But it seemed to me,
when one had nothing to eat and was beaten, it was a different
affair. I would not have stolen for tartlets, I believe; but
any one would steal for baker&rsquo;s bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I suppose,&rdquo; said the Doctor, with a rising sneer,
&ldquo;you prayed God to forgive you, and explained the case to
Him at length.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir?&rdquo; asked Jean-Marie. &ldquo;I do not see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your priest would see, however,&rdquo; retorted Desprez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would he?&rdquo; asked the boy, troubled for the first
time. &ldquo;I should have thought God would have
known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; snarled the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have thought God would have understood
me,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;You do not, I see; but then it
was God that made me think so, was it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little boy, little boy,&rdquo; said Dr. Desprez, &ldquo;I told you
already you had the vices of philosophy; if you display the
virtues also, I must go. I am a student of the blessed laws
of health, an observer of plain and temperate nature in her
common walks; and I cannot preserve my equanimity in
presence of a monster. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will make my meaning clear to you,&rdquo; replied the
Doctor. &ldquo;Look there at the sky&mdash;behind the belfry first,
where it is so light, and then up and up, turning your chin
back, right to the top of the dome, where it is already as blue
as at noon. Is not that a beautiful colour? Does it not
please the heart? We have seen it all our lives, until it has
grown in with our familiar thoughts. Now,&rdquo; changing his
tone, &ldquo;suppose that sky to become suddenly of a live and
fiery amber, like the colour of clear coals, and growing
scarlet towards the top&mdash;I do not say it would be any the
less beautiful; but would you like it as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; answered Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I like you,&rdquo; returned the Doctor roughly.
&ldquo;I hate all odd people, and you are the most curious little
boy in all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean-Marie seemed to ponder for a while, and then he
raised his head again and looked over at the Doctor with an
air of candid inquiry. &ldquo;But are not you a very curious
gentleman?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The Doctor threw away his stick, bounded on the boy,
clasped him to his bosom, and kissed him on both cheeks.
&ldquo;Admirable, admirable imp!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What a morning,
what an hour for a theorist of forty-two! No,&rdquo; he continued,
apostrophising heaven, &ldquo;I did not know such boys
existed; I was ignorant they made them so; I had doubted
of my race; and now! It is like,&rdquo; he added, picking up his
stick, &ldquo;like a lovers&rsquo; meeting. I have bruised my favourite
staff in that moment of enthusiasm. The injury, however,
is not grave.&rdquo; He caught the boy looking at him in obvious
wonder, embarrassment, and alarm. &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;why do you look at me like that? Egad, I believe the
boy despises me. Do you despise me, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Jean-Marie seriously; &ldquo;only I do not
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must excuse me, sir,&rdquo; returned the Doctor, with
gravity; &ldquo;I am still so young. Oh, hang him!&rdquo; he added
to himself. And he took his seat again and observed the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
sardonically. &ldquo;He has spoiled the quiet of my morning,&rdquo;
thought he. &ldquo;I shall be nervous all day, and have a febricule
when I digest. Let me compose myself.&rdquo; And so he
dismissed his preoccupations by an effort of the will which he
had long practised, and let his soul roam abroad in the contemplation
of the morning. He inhaled the air, tasting it
critically as a connoisseur tastes a vintage, and prolonging
the expiration with hygienic gusto. He counted the little
flecks of cloud along the sky. He followed the movements
of the birds round the church tower&mdash;making long sweeps,
hanging poised, or turning airy somersaults in fancy, and
beating the wind with imaginary pinions. And in this way
he regained peace of mind and animal composure, conscious
of his limbs, conscious of the sight of his eyes, conscious that
the air had a cool taste, like a fruit, at the top of his throat;
and at last, in complete abstraction, he began to sing. The
Doctor had but one air&mdash;&ldquo;Malbrouck s&rsquo;en va-t-en guerre&rdquo;;
even with that he was on terms of mere politeness; and his
musical exploits were always reserved for moments when he
was alone and entirely happy.</p>

<p>He was recalled to earth rudely by a pained expression
on the boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What do you think of my singing?&rdquo;
he inquired, stopping in the middle of a note; and then, after
he had waited some little while and received no answer,
&ldquo;What do you think of my singing?&rdquo; he repeated imperiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like it,&rdquo; faltered Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;Possibly you are a
performer yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sing better than that,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>

<p>The Doctor eyed him for some seconds in stupefaction.
He was aware that he was angry, and blushed for himself in
consequence, which made him angrier. &ldquo;If this is how you
address your master!&rdquo; he said at last, with a shrug and a
flourish of his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not speak to him at all,&rdquo; returned the boy. &ldquo;I
do not like him.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you like me?&rdquo; snapped Doctor Desprez, with
unusual eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; answered Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>The Doctor rose. &ldquo;I shall wish you a good-morning,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You are too much for me. Perhaps you have
blood in your veins, perhaps celestial ichor, or perhaps you
circulate nothing more gross than respirable air; but of one
thing I am inexpugnably assured:&mdash;that you are no human
being. No, boy&rdquo;&mdash;shaking his stick at him&mdash;&ldquo;you are not
a human being. Write, write it in your memory&mdash;&lsquo;I am not
a human being&mdash;I have no pretension to be a human being&mdash;I
am a dive, a dream, an angel, an acrostic, an illusion&mdash;what
you please, but not a human being.&rsquo; And so accept
my humble salutations and farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that the Doctor made off along the street in
some emotion, and the boy stood, mentally gaping, where he
left him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE ADOPTION</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Madame</span> Desprez, who answered to the Christian name of
Anastasie, presented an agreeable type of her sex; exceedingly
wholesome to look upon, a stout <i>brune</i>, with cool
smooth cheeks, steady, dark eyes, and hands that neither
art nor nature could improve. She was the sort of person
over whom adversity passes like a summer cloud; she might,
in the worst of conjunctions, knit her brows into one vertical
furrow for a moment, but the next it would be gone. She
had much of the placidity of a contented nun; with little
of her piety, however; for Anastasie was of a very mundane
nature, fond of oysters and old wine, and somewhat bold
pleasantries, and devoted to her husband for her own sake
rather than for his. She was imperturbably good-natured,
but had no idea of self-sacrifice. To live in that pleasant
old house, with a green garden behind and bright flowers
about the window, to eat and drink of the best, to gossip
with a neighbour for a quarter of an hour, never to wear
stays or a dress except when she went to Fontainebleau
shopping, to be kept in a continual supply of racy novels,
and to be married to Dr. Desprez and have no ground of
jealousy, filled the cup of her nature to the brim. Those
who had known the Doctor in bachelor days, when he had
aired quite as many theories, but of a different order, attributed
his present philosophy to the study of Anastasie. It
was her brute enjoyment that he rationalised and perhaps
vainly imitated.</p>

<p>Madame Desprez was an artist in the kitchen, and
made coffee to a nicety. She had a knack of tidiness, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
which she had infected the Doctor; everything was in its
place; everything capable of polish shone gloriously; and
dust was a thing banished from her empire. Aline, their
single servant, had no other business in the world but to
scour and burnish. So Doctor Desprez lived in his house
like a fatted calf, warmed and cosseted to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

<p>The midday meal was excellent. There was a ripe
melon, a fish from the river in a memorable B&eacute;arnaise sauce,
a fat fowl in a fricassee, and a dish of asparagus, followed by
some fruit. The Doctor drank half a bottle <i>plus</i> one glass,
the wife half a bottle <i>minus</i> the same quantity, which was a
marital privilege, of an excellent C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie, seven years old.
Then the coffee was brought, and a flask of Chartreuse for
madame, for the Doctor despised and distrusted such decoctions;
and then Aline left the wedded pair to the pleasures
of memory and digestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a very fortunate circumstance, my cherished one,&rdquo;
observed the Doctor&mdash;&ldquo;this coffee is adorable&mdash;a very
fortunate circumstance upon the whole&mdash;Anastasie, I
beseech you, go without that poison for to-day; only one
day, and you will feel the benefit, I pledge my reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this fortunate circumstance, my friend?&rdquo;
inquired Anastasie, not heeding his protest, which was of
daily recurrence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we have no children, my beautiful,&rdquo; replied the
Doctor. &ldquo;I think of it more and more as the years go on,
and with more and more gratitude towards the power that
dispenses such afflictions. Your health, my darling, my
studious quiet, our little kitchen delicacies, how they would
all have suffered, how they would all have been sacrificed!
And for what? Children are the last word of human imperfection.
Health flees before their face. They cry, my dear;
they put vexatious questions; they demand to be fed, to be
washed, to be educated, to have their noses blown; and then,
when the time comes, they break our hearts, as I break this
piece of sugar. A pair of professed egoists, like you and
me, should avoid offspring, like an infidelity.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said she; and she laughed. &ldquo;Now, that is
like you&mdash;to take credit for the thing you could not help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; returned the Doctor solemnly, &ldquo;we might
have adopted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried madame. &ldquo;Never, Doctor, with my
consent. If the child were my own flesh and blood, I would
not say no. But to take another person&rsquo;s indiscretion on
my shoulders, my dear friend, I have too much sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;We both had.
And I am all the better pleased with our wisdom, because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo; she asked, with a faint premonition
of danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I have found the right person,&rdquo; said the
Doctor firmly, &ldquo;and shall adopt him this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anastasie looked at him out of a mist. &ldquo;You have
lost your reason,&rdquo; she said; and there was a clang in her
voice that seemed to threaten trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so, my dear,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I retain its complete
exercise. To the proof: instead of attempting to cloak
my inconsistency, I have, by way of preparing you, thrown
it into strong relief. You will there, I think, recognise
the philosopher who has the ecstasy to call you wife. The
fact is, I have been reckoning all this while without an
accident. I never thought to find a son of my own. Now,
last night, I found one. Do not unnecessarily alarm yourself,
my dear; he is not a drop of blood to me that I know.
It is his mind, darling, his mind that calls me father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mind!&rdquo; she repeated, with a titter between scorn
and hysterics. &ldquo;His mind, indeed! Henri, is this an
idiotic pleasantry, or are you mad? His mind! And
what of my mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, with a shrug, &ldquo;you have
your finger on the hitch. He will be strikingly antipathetic
to my ever beautiful Anastasie. She will never understand
him; he will never understand her. You married the
animal side of my nature, dear; and it is on the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
side that I find my affinity for Jean-Marie. So much so,
that, to be perfectly frank, I stand in some awe of him
myself. You will easily perceive that I am announcing
a calamity for you. Do not,&rdquo; he broke out in tones of real
solicitude&mdash;&ldquo;do not give way to tears after a meal, Anastasie.
You will certainly give yourself a false digestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anastasie controlled herself. &ldquo;You know how willing
I am to humour you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in all reasonable matters.
But on this point&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear love,&rdquo; interrupted the Doctor, eager to prevent
a refusal, &ldquo;who wished to leave Paris? Who made
me give up cards, and the opera, and the boulevard, and
my social relations, and all that was my life before I knew
you? Have I been faithful? Have I been obedient?
Have I not borne my doom with cheerfulness? In all
honesty, Anastasie, have I not a right to a stipulation on
my side? I have, and you know it. I stipulate my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anastasie was aware of defeat; she struck her colours
instantly. &ldquo;You will break my heart,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You will feel a trifling
inconvenience for a month, just as I did when I was first
brought to this vile hamlet; then your admirable sense and
temper will prevail, and I see you already as content as
ever, and making your husband the happiest of
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I can refuse you nothing,&rdquo; she said, with
a last flicker of resistance; &ldquo;nothing that will make you
truly happier. But will this? Are you sure, my husband?
Last night, you say, you found him! He may be the worst
of humbugs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;But do not
suppose me so unwary as to adopt him out of hand. I am,
I flatter myself, a finished man of the world; I have had
all possibilities in view; my plan is contrived to meet them
all. I take the lad as stable-boy. If he pilfer, if he grumble,
if he desire to change, I shall see I was mistaken; I shall
recognise him for no son of mine, and send him tramping.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You will never do so when the time comes,&rdquo; said his
wife; &ldquo;I know your good heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached out her hand to him, with a sigh; the
Doctor smiled as he took it and carried it to his lips; he
had gained his point with greater ease than he had dared
to hope; for perhaps the twentieth time he had proved
the efficacy of his trusty argument, his Excalibur, the hint
of a return to Paris. Six months in the capital, for a man
of the Doctor&rsquo;s antecedents and relations, implied no less
a calamity than total ruin. Anastasie had saved the remainder
of his fortune by keeping him strictly in the
country. The very name of Paris put her in a blue fear;
and she would have allowed her husband to keep a menagerie
in the back-garden, let alone adopting a stable-boy,
rather than permit the question of return to be discussed.</p>

<p>About four of the afternoon, the mountebank rendered
up his ghost; he had never been conscious since his seizure.
Doctor Desprez was present at his last passage, and declared
the farce over. Then he took Jean-Marie by the shoulder
and led him out into the inn garden, where there was a convenient
bench beside the river. Here he sat him down and
made the boy place himself on his left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean-Marie,&rdquo; he said very gravely, &ldquo;this world is
exceedingly vast; and even France, which is only a small
corner of it, is a great place for a little lad like you. Unfortunately
it is full of eager, shouldering people moving
on; and there are very few bakers&rsquo; shops for so many eaters.
Your master is dead; you are not fit to gain a living by
yourself; you do not wish to steal? No. Your situation
then is undesirable; it is, for the moment, critical. On
the other hand, you behold in me a man not old, though
elderly, still enjoying the youth of the heart and the intelligence;
a man of instruction; easily situated in this
world&rsquo;s affairs; keeping a good table:&mdash;a man, neither as
friend nor host, to be despised. I offer you your food and
clothes, and to teach you lessons in the evening, which will
be infinitely more to the purpose for a lad of your stamp than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
those of all the priests in Europe. I propose no wages, but
if ever you take a thought to leave me, the door shall be
open, and I will give you a hundred francs to start the
world upon. In return, I have an old horse and chaise,
which you would very speedily learn to clean and keep
in order. Do not hurry yourself to answer, and take it or
leave it as you judge aright. Only remember this, that
I am no sentimentalist or charitable person, but a man who
lives rigorously to himself; and that if I make the proposal,
it is for my own ends&mdash;it is because I perceive clearly an
advantage to myself. And now, reflect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad. I do not see what else I can do.
I thank you, sir, most kindly, and I will try to be useful,&rdquo;
said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Doctor warmly, rising at the
same time and wiping his brow, for he had suffered agonies
while the thing hung in the wind. A refusal, after the
scene at noon, would have placed him in a ridiculous light
before Anastasie. &ldquo;How hot and heavy is the evening,
to be sure! I have always had a fancy to be a fish in
summer, Jean-Marie, here in the Loing beside Gretz. I
should lie under a water-lily and listen to the bells, which
must sound most delicately down below. That would be
a life&mdash;do you not think so too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God you have imagination!&rdquo; cried the Doctor,
embracing the boy with his usual effusive warmth, though
it was a proceeding that seemed to disconcert the sufferer
almost as much as if he had been an English schoolboy of
the same age. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I will take you
to my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Desprez sat in the dining-room in a cool
wrapper. All the blinds were down, and the tile floor had
been recently sprinkled with water; her eyes were half
shut, but she affected to be reading a novel as they entered.
Though she was a bustling woman, she enjoyed repose
between-whiles and had a remarkable appetite for sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>The Doctor went through a solemn form of introduction,
adding, for the benefit of both parties, &ldquo;You must try to
like each other for my sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very pretty,&rdquo; said Anastasie.&mdash;&ldquo;Will you kiss
me, my pretty little fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor was furious, and dragged her into the
passage. &ldquo;Are you a fool, Anastasie?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
is all this I hear about the tact of women? Heaven knows,
I have not met with it in my experience. You address my
little philosopher as if he were an infant. He must be
spoken to with more respect, I tell you; he must not be
kissed and Georgy-porgy&rsquo;d like an ordinary child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only did it to please you, I am sure,&rdquo; replied Anastasie;
&ldquo;but I will try to do better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor apologised for his warmth. &ldquo;But I do
wish him,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to feel at home among us. And
really your conduct was so idiotic, my cherished one, and
so utterly and distantly out of place, that a saint might have
been pardoned a little vehemence in disapproval. Do, do
try&mdash;if it is possible for a woman to understand young
people&mdash;but of course it is not, and I waste my breath.
Hold your tongue as much as possible at least, and observe
my conduct narrowly; it will serve you for a model.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anastasie did as she was bidden, and considered the
Doctor&rsquo;s behaviour. She observed that he embraced the
boy three times in the course of the evening, and managed
generally to confound and abash the little fellow out of
speech and appetite. But she had the true womanly
heroism in little affairs. Not only did she refrain from
the cheap revenge of exposing the Doctor&rsquo;s errors to himself,
but she did her best to remove their ill-effect on Jean-Marie.
When Desprez went out for his last breath of air
before retiring for the night, she came over to the boy&rsquo;s
side and took his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not be surprised or frightened by my husband&rsquo;s
manners,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is the kindest of men,
but so clever that he is sometimes difficult to understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
You will soon grow used to him, and then you will love him,
for that nobody can help. As for me, you may be sure, I
shall try to make you happy, and will not bother you at all.
I think we should be excellent friends, you and I. I am
not clever, but I am very good-natured. Will you give me
a kiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held up his face, and she took him in her arms and
then began to cry. The woman had spoken in complaisance;
but she had warmed to her own words, and tenderness
followed. The Doctor, entering, found them enlaced: he
concluded that his wife was in fault; and he was just beginning,
in an awful voice, &ldquo;Anastasie&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; when she
looked up at him, smiling, with an upraised finger; and he
held his peace, wondering, while she led the boy to his attic.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>THE EDUCATION OF A PHILOSOPHER</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> installation of the adopted stable-boy was thus happily
effected, and the wheels of life continued to run smoothly in
the Doctor&rsquo;s house. Jean-Marie did his horse and carriage
duty in the morning; sometimes helped in the housework;
sometimes walked abroad with the Doctor, to drink wisdom
from the fountainhead; and was introduced at night to
the sciences and the dead tongues. He retained his singular
placidity of mind and manner; he was rarely in fault; but
he made only a very partial progress in his studies, and remained
much of a stranger in the family.</p>

<p>The Doctor was a pattern of regularity. All forenoon he
worked on his great book, the &ldquo;Comparative Pharmacop&oelig;ia,
or Historical Dictionary of all Medicines,&rdquo; which as
yet consisted principally of slips of paper and pins. When
finished, it was to fill many personable volumes, and to
combine antiquarian interest with professional utility.
But the Doctor was studious of literary graces and the
picturesque; an anecdote, a touch of manners, a moral
qualification, or a sounding epithet was sure to be preferred
before a piece of science; a little more, and he would have
written the &ldquo;Comparative Pharmacop&oelig;ia&rdquo; in verse! The
article &ldquo;Mummia,&rdquo; for instance, was already complete,
though the remainder of the work had not progressed beyond
the letter A. It was exceedingly copious and entertaining,
written with quaintness and colour, exact, erudite,
a literary article; but it would hardly have afforded guidance
to a practising physician of to-day. The feminine
good sense of his wife had led her to point this out with un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>compromising
sincerity; for the Dictionary was duly read
aloud to her, betwixt sleep and waking, as it proceeded towards
an infinitely distant completion; and the Doctor was
a little sore on the subject of mummies, and sometimes resented
an allusion with asperity.</p>

<p>After the midday meal and a proper period of digestion,
he walked, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by
Jean-Marie; for madame would have preferred any hardship
rather than walk.</p>

<p>She was, as I have said, a very busy person, continually
occupied about material comforts, and ready to drop asleep
over a novel the instant she was disengaged. This was the
less objectionable, as she never snored or grew distempered
in complexion when she slept. On the contrary, she looked
the very picture of luxurious and appetising ease, and woke
without a start to the perfect possession of her faculties. I
am afraid she was greatly an animal, but she was a very nice
animal to have about. In this way she had little to do with
Jean-Marie; but the sympathy which had been established
between them on the first night remained unbroken; they
held occasional conversations, mostly on household matters;
to the extreme disappointment of the Doctor, they occasionally
sallied off together to that temple of debasing, superstition,
the village church; madame and he, both in their
Sunday&rsquo;s best, drove twice a month to Fontainebleau and
returned laden with purchases; and in short, although the
Doctor still continued to regard them as irreconcilably antipathetic,
their relation was as intimate, friendly, and confidential
as their natures suffered.</p>

<p>I fear, however, that in her heart of hearts madame kindly
despised and pitied the boy. She had no admiration for his
class of virtues; she liked a smart, polite, forward, roguish
sort of boy, cap in hand, light of foot, meeting the eye;
she liked volubility, charm, a little vice&mdash;the promise
of a second Doctor Desprez. And it was her indefeasible
belief that Jean-Marie was dull. &ldquo;Poor dear boy,&rdquo; she had
said once, &ldquo;how sad it is that he should be so stupid!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
She had never repeated that remark, for the Doctor had raged
like a wild bull, denouncing the brutal bluntness of her
mind, bemoaning his own fate to be so unequally mated
with an ass, and, what touched Anastasie more nearly,
menacing the table china by the fury of his gesticulations.
But she adhered silently to her opinion; and when Jean-Marie
was sitting, stolid, blank, but not unhappy, over his
unfinished tasks, she would snatch her opportunity in the
Doctor&rsquo;s absence, go over to him, put her arms about his
neck, lay her cheek to his, and communicate her sympathy
with his distress. &ldquo;Do not mind,&rdquo; she would say; &ldquo;I,
too, am not at all clever, and I can assure you that it makes
no difference in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s view was naturally different. That gentleman
never wearied of the sound of his own voice, which was,
to say the truth, agreeable enough to hear. He now had a
listener, who was not so cynically indifferent as Anastasie,
and who sometimes put him on his mettle by the most
relevant objections. Besides, was he not educating the boy?
And education, philosophers are agreed, is the most philosophical
of duties. What can be more heavenly to poor
mankind than to have one&rsquo;s hobby grow into a duty to the
State? Then, indeed, do the ways of life become ways of
pleasantness. Never had the Doctor seen reason to be more
content with his endowments. Philosophy flowed smoothly
from his lips. He was so agile a dialectician that he could
trace his nonsense, when challenged, back to some root in
sense, and prove it to be a sort of flower upon his system.
He slipped out of antinomies like a fish, and left his disciple
marvelling at the rabbi&rsquo;s depth.</p>

<p>Moreover, deep down in his heart the Doctor was disappointed
with the ill-success of his more formal education.
A boy, chosen by so acute an observer for his aptitude, and
guided along the path of learning by so philosophic an instructor,
was bound, by the nature of the universe, to make
a more obvious and lasting advance. Now Jean-Marie was
slow in all things, impenetrable in others; and his power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
forgetting was fully on a level with his power to learn.
Therefore the Doctor cherished his peripatetic lectures, to
which the boy attended, which he generally appeared to
enjoy, and by which he often profited.</p>

<p>Many and many were the talks they had together; and
health and moderation proved the subject of the Doctor&rsquo;s
divagations. To these he lovingly returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lead you,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;by the green pastures.
My system, my beliefs, my medicines, are resumed in one
phrase&mdash;to avoid excess. Blessed nature, healthy, temperate
nature, abhors and exterminates excess. Human
law, in this matter, imitates at a great distance her provisions;
and we must strive to supplement the efforts of the
law. Yes, boy, we must be a law to ourselves and for our
neighbours&mdash;<i>lex armata</i>&mdash;armed, emphatic, tyrannous law.
If you see a crapulous human ruin snuffing, dash from him
his box! The judge, though in a way an admission of disease,
is less offensive to me than either the doctor or the
priest. Above all the doctor&mdash;the doctor and the purulent
trash and garbage of his pharmacop&oelig;ia! Pure air&mdash;from
the neighbourhood of a pinetum for the sake of the turpentine&mdash;unadulterated
wine, and the reflections of an unsophisticated
spirit in the presence of the works of nature&mdash;these,
my boy, are the best medical appliances and the best religious
comforts. Devote yourself to these. Hark! there
are the bells of Bourron (the wind is in the north, it will be
fair). How clear and airy is the sound. The nerves are
harmonised and quieted; the mind attuned to silence; and
observe how easily and regularly beats the heart! Your
unenlightened doctor would see nothing in these sensations;
and yet you yourself perceive they are a part of health.
Did you remember your cinchona this morning? Good.
Cinchona also is a work of nature; it is, after all, only the
bark of a tree which we might gather for ourselves if we
lived in the locality. What a world is this! Though a professed
atheist, I delight to bear my testimony to the world.
Look at the gratuitous remedies and pleasures that surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
our path! The river runs by the garden end, our bath, our
fish-pond, our natural system of drainage. There is a well
in the court which sends up sparkling water from the earth&rsquo;s
very heart, clean, cool, and, with a little wine, most wholesome.
The district is notorious for its salubrity; rheumatism
is the only prevalent complaint, and I myself have never
had a touch of it. I tell you&mdash;and my opinion is based upon
the coldest, clearest processes of reason&mdash;if I, if you, desired
to leave this home of pleasures, it would be the duty, it
would be the privilege, of our best friend to prevent us with
a pistol bullet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One beautiful June day they sat upon the hill outside
the village. The river, as blue as heaven, shone here and
there among the foliage. The indefatigable birds turned
and flickered about Gretz church-tower. A healthy wind
blew from over the forest, and the sound of innumerable
thousands of tree-tops and innumerable millions on millions
of green leaves was abroad in the air, and filled the ear with
something between whispered speech and singing. It
seemed as if every blade of grass must hide a cigale; and the
fields rang merrily with their music, jingling far and near
as with the sleigh-bells of the fairy queen. From their
station on the slope the eye embraced a large space of poplared
plain upon the one hand, the waving hill-tops of the
forest on the other, and Gretz itself in the middle, a handful
of roofs. Under the bestriding arch of the blue heavens,
the place seemed dwindled to a toy. It seemed incredible
that people dwelt, and could find room to turn or air to
breathe, in such a corner of the world. The thought came
home to the boy, perhaps for the first time, and he gave it
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How small it looks!&rdquo; he sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, &ldquo;small enough now. Yet it
was once a walled city; thriving, full of furred burgesses
and men in armour, humming with affairs;&mdash;with tall spires,
for aught that I know, and portly towers along the battlements.
A thousand chimneys ceased smoking at the curfew-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>bell.
There were gibbets at the gate as thick as scarecrows.
In time of war, the assault swarmed against it with ladders,
the arrows fell like leaves, the defenders sallied hotly over
the drawbridge, each side uttered its cry as they plied their
weapons. Do you know that the walls extended as far as
the Commanderie? Tradition so reports. Alas! what a
long way off is all this confusion&mdash;nothing left of it but my
quiet words spoken in your ear&mdash;and the town itself shrunk
to the hamlet underneath us! By-and-by came the English
wars&mdash;you shall hear more of the English, a stupid people,
who sometimes blundered into good&mdash;and Gretz was taken,
sacked, and burned. It is the history of many towns; but
Gretz never rose again; it was never rebuilt; its ruins were a
quarry to serve the growth of rivals; and the stones of Gretz
are now erect along the streets of Nemours. It gratifies me
that our old house was the first to rise after the calamity;
when the town had come to an end, it inaugurated the
hamlet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, am glad of that,&rdquo; said Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should be the temple of the humbler virtues,&rdquo;
responded the Doctor with a savoury gusto. &ldquo;Perhaps one
of the reasons why I love my little hamlet as I do, is that we
have a similar history, she and I. Have I told you that I
was once rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; answered Jean-Marie. &ldquo;I do not
think I should have forgotten. I am sorry you should have
lost your fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;Why, I find I have
scarce begun your education after all. Listen to me!
Would you rather live in the old Gretz or in the new, free
from the alarms of war, with the green country at the door,
without noise, passports, the exactions of the soldiery, or
the jangle of the curfew-bell to send us off to bed by sundown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should prefer the new,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; returned the Doctor; &ldquo;so do I. And in
the same way, I prefer my present moderate fortune to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
former wealth. Golden mediocrity! cried the adorable
ancients; and I subscribe to their enthusiasm. Have I not
good wine, good food, good air, the fields and the forest for
my walk, a house, an admirable wife, a boy whom I protest
I cherish like a son? Now, if I were still rich, I should indubitably
make my residence in Paris&mdash;you know Paris&mdash;Paris
and Paradise are not convertible terms. This pleasant
noise of the wind streaming among leaves changed into the
grinding Babel of the street, the stupid glare of plaster substituted
for this quiet pattern of greens and greys, the nerves
shattered, the digestion falsified&mdash;picture the fall! Already
you perceive the consequences: the mind is stimulated, the
heart steps to a different measure, and the man is himself no
longer. I have passionately studied myself&mdash;the true
business of philosophy. I know my character as the
musician knows the ventages of his flute. Should I return
to Paris, I should ruin myself gambling; nay, I go further&mdash;I
should break the heart of my Anastasie with infidelities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was too much for Jean-Marie. That a place should
so transform the most excellent of men transcended his
belief. Paris, he protested, was even an agreeable place of
residence. &ldquo;Nor when I lived in that city did I feel much
difference,&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;Did you not steal when
you were there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the boy could never be brought to see that he had
done anything wrong when he stole. Nor, indeed, did the
Doctor think he had; but that gentleman was never very
scrupulous when in want of a retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;do you begin to understand?
My only friends were those who ruined me. Gretz
has been my academy, my sanatorium, my heaven of innocent
pleasures. If millions are offered me, I wave them
back: <i>Retro, Sathanas!</i>&mdash;Evil one, begone! Fix your mind
on my example; despise riches, avoid the debasing influence
of cities. Hygiene&mdash;hygiene and mediocrity of fortune&mdash;these
be your watchwords during life!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s system of hygiene strikingly coincided with
his tastes; and his picture of the perfect life was a faithful
description of the one he was leading at the time. But it is
easy to convince a boy, whom you supply with all the facts
for the discussion. And besides, there was one thing admirable
in the philosophy, and that was the enthusiasm of the
philosopher. There was never any one more vigorously
determined to be pleased; and if he was not a great logician,
and so had no right to convince the intellect, he was
certainly something of a poet, and had a fascination
to seduce the heart. What he could not achieve in his
customary humour of a radiant admiration of himself
and his circumstances, he sometimes effected in his fits of
gloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;avoid me to-day. If I were
superstitious, I should even beg for an interest in your
prayers. I am in the black fit; the evil spirit of King Saul,
the hag of the merchant Abudah, the personal devil of the
medi&aelig;val monk, is with me&mdash;is in me,&rdquo; tapping on his breast.
&ldquo;The vices of my nature are now uppermost; innocent
pleasures woo me in vain; I long for Paris, for my wallowing
in the mire. See,&rdquo; he would continue, producing a
handful of silver, &ldquo;I denude myself, I am not to be trusted
with the price of a fare. Take it, keep it for me, squander
it on deleterious candy, throw it in the deepest of the river&mdash;I
will homologate your action. Save me from that part of
myself which I disown. If you see me falter, do not hesitate;
if necessary, wreck the train! I speak, of course, by a
parable. Any extremity were better than for me to reach
Paris alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doubtless the Doctor enjoyed these little scenes, as a
variation in his part; they represented the Byronic element
in the somewhat artificial poetry of his existence; but to the
boy, though he was dimly aware of their theatricality, they
represented more. The Doctor made perhaps too little,
the boy possibly too much, of the reality and gravity of
these temptations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>One day a great light shone for Jean-Marie. &ldquo;Could
not riches be used well?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In theory, yes,&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;But it is found
in experience that no one does so. All the world imagine
they will be exceptional when they grow wealthy; but
possession is debasing, new desires spring up; and the silly
taste for ostentation eats out the heart of pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you might be better if you had less,&rdquo; said the
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the Doctor; but his voice
quavered as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded pitiless innocence.</p>

<p>Doctor Desprez saw all the colours of the rainbow in a
moment; the stable universe appeared to be about capsizing
with him. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he&mdash;affecting deliberation
after an obvious pause&mdash;&ldquo;because I have formed my
life for my present income. It is not good for men of my
years to be violently dissevered from their habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was a sharp brush. The Doctor breathed hard,
and fell into taciturnity for the afternoon. As for the boy,
he was delighted with the resolution of his doubts; even
wondered that he had not foreseen the obvious and conclusive
answer. His faith in the Doctor was a stout piece of
goods. Desprez was inclined to be a sheet in the wind&rsquo;s eye
after dinner, especially after Rhone wine, his favourite weakness.
He would then remark on the warmth of his feeling
for Anastasie, and with inflamed cheeks and a loose, flustered
smile, debate upon all sorts of topics, and be feebly and indiscreetly
witty. But the adopted stable-boy would not
permit himself to entertain a doubt that savoured of ingratitude.
It is quite true that a man may be a second
father to you, and yet take too much to drink; but the best
natures are ever slow to accept such truths.</p>

<p>The Doctor thoroughly possessed his heart, but perhaps
he exaggerated his influence over his mind. Certainly Jean-Marie
adopted some of his master&rsquo;s opinions, but I have yet
to learn that he ever surrendered one of his own. Convic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>tions
existed in him by divine right; they were virgin, unwrought,
the brute metal of decision. He could add others
indeed, but he could not put away; neither did he care if
they were perfectly agreed among themselves; and his
spiritual pleasures had nothing to do with turning them
over or justifying them in words. Words were with him a
mere accomplishment, like dancing. When he was by himself,
his pleasures were almost vegetable. He would slip
into the woods towards Ach&egrave;res, and sit in the mouth of a
cave among grey birches. His soul stared straight out of
his eyes; he did not move or think; sunlight, thin shadows
moving in the wind, the edge of firs against the sky, occupied
and bound his faculties. He was pure unity, a spirit wholly
abstracted. A single mood filled him, to which all the
objects of sense contributed, as the colours of the spectrum
merge and disappear in white light.</p>

<p>So while the Doctor made himself drunk with words, the
adopted stable-boy bemused himself with silence.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>TREASURE TROVE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Doctor&rsquo;s carriage was a two-wheeled gig with a hood;
a kind of vehicle in much favour among country doctors.
On how many roads has one not seen it, a great way off
between the poplars!&mdash;in how many village streets, tied to
a gate-post! This sort of chariot is affected&mdash;particularly
at the trot&mdash;by a kind of pitching movement to and fro
across the axle, which well entitles it to the style of a Noddy.
The hood describes a considerable arc against the landscape,
with a solemnly absurd effect on the contemplative pedestrian.
To ride in such a carriage cannot be numbered
among the things that appertain to glory; but I have no
doubt it may be useful in liver complaint. Thence, perhaps,
its wide popularity among physicians.</p>

<p>One morning early, Jean-Marie led forth the Doctor&rsquo;s
noddy, opened the gate, and mounted to the driving-seat.
The Doctor followed, arrayed from top to toe in spotless
linen, armed with an immense flesh-coloured umbrella, and
girt with a botanical case on a baldric; and the equipage
drove off smartly in a breeze of its own provocation. They
were bound for Franchard, to collect plants, with an eye to
the &ldquo;Comparative Pharmacop&oelig;ia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little rattling on the open roads, and they came to the
borders of the forest and struck into an unfrequented track;
the noddy yawed softly over the sand, with an accompaniment
of snapping twigs. There was a great, green, softly
murmuring cloud of congregated foliage overhead. In the
arcades of the forest the air retained the freshness of the
night. The athletic bearing of the trees, each carrying its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
leafy mountain, pleased the mind like so many statues; and
the lines of the trunk led the eye admiringly upward to where
the extreme leaves sparkled in a patch of azure. Squirrels
leaped in mid-air. It was a proper spot for a devotee of the
goddess Hygieia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been to Franchard, Jean-Marie?&rdquo; inquired
the Doctor. &ldquo;I fancy not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a ruin in a gorge,&rdquo; continued Desprez, adopting his
expository voice; &ldquo;the ruin of a hermitage and chapel.
History tells us much of Franchard; how the recluse was
often slain by robbers; how he lived on a most insufficient
diet; how he was expected to pass his days in prayer. A
letter is preserved, addressed to one of these solitaries by
the superior of his order, full of admirable hygienic advice;
bidding him go from his book to praying, and so back again,
for variety&rsquo;s sake, and when he was weary of both to stroll
about his garden and observe the honey-bees. It is to this
day my own system. You must often have remarked me
leaving the &lsquo;Pharmacop&oelig;ia&rsquo;&mdash;often even in the middle of a
phrase&mdash;to come forth into the sun and air. I admire the
writer of that letter from my heart; he was a man of thought
on the most important subjects. But, indeed, had I lived
in the Middle Ages (I am heartily glad that I did not) I
should have been an eremite myself&mdash;if I had not been a
professed buffoon, that is. These were the only philosophical
lives yet open: laughter or prayer; sneers, we might say,
and tears. Until the sun of the Positive arose, the wise
man had to make his choice between these two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been a buffoon, of course,&rdquo; observed Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine you to have excelled in your profession,&rdquo;
said the doctor, admiring the boy&rsquo;s gravity. &ldquo;Do
you ever laugh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I laugh often. I am
very fond of jokes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Singular being!&rdquo; said Desprez. &ldquo;But I divagate (I
perceive in a thousand ways that I grow old). Franchard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
was at length destroyed in the English wars, the same that
levelled Gretz. But&mdash;here is the point&mdash;the hermits (for
there were already more than one) had foreseen the danger
and carefully concealed the sacrificial vessels. These
vessels were of monstrous value, Jean-Marie&mdash;monstrous
value&mdash;priceless, we may say; exquisitely worked,
of exquisite material. And now, mark me, they have
never been found. In the reign of Louis Quatorze some
fellows were digging hard by the ruins. Suddenly&mdash;tock!&mdash;the
spade hit upon an obstacle. Imagine the
men looking one to another; imagine how their hearts
bounded, how their colour came and went. It was a coffer,
and in Franchard, the place of buried treasure! They tore
it open like famished beasts. Alas! it was not the treasure;
only some priestly robes, which, at the touch of the eating
air, fell upon themselves and instantly wasted into dust. The
perspiration of these good fellows turned cold upon them,
Jean-Marie. I will pledge my reputation, if there was anything
like a cutting wind, one or other had a pneumonia for
his trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to have seen them turning into dust,&rdquo;
said Jean-Marie. &ldquo;Otherwise, I should not have cared so
greatly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no imagination,&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;Picture
to yourself the scene. Dwell on the idea&mdash;a great
treasure lying in the earth for centuries: the material for a
giddy, copious, opulent existence not employed; dresses
and exquisite pictures unseen; the swiftest galloping horses
not stirring a hoof, arrested by a spell; women with the
beautiful faculty of smiles, not smiling; cards, dice,
opera singing, orchestras, castles, beautiful parks and gardens,
big ships with a tower of sailcloth, all lying unborn
in a coffin&mdash;and the stupid trees growing overhead in
the sunlight, year after year. The thought drives one
frantic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only money,&rdquo; replied Jean-Marie. &ldquo;It would do
harm.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; cried Desprez, &ldquo;that is philosophy; it is
all very fine, but not to the point just now. And besides,
it is not &lsquo;only money,&rsquo; as you call it; there are works of
art in the question; the vessels were carved. You speak
like a child. You weary me exceedingly, quoting my
words out of all logical connection, like a parroquet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And at any rate, we have nothing to do with it,&rdquo; returned
the boy submissively.</p>

<p>They struck the Route Ronde at that moment; and the
sudden change to the rattling causeway combined, with the
Doctor&rsquo;s irritation, to keep him silent. The noddy jigged
along; the trees went by, looking on silently, as if they had
something on their minds. The Quadrilateral was passed;
then came Franchard. They put up the horse at the little
solitary inn, and went forth strolling. The gorge was dyed
deeply with heather; the rocks and birches standing luminous
in the sun. A great humming of bees about the flowers
disposed Jean-Marie to sleep, and he sat down against a
clump of heather, while the Doctor went briskly to and fro,
with quick turns, culling his simples.</p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s head had fallen a little forward, his eyes were
closed, his fingers had fallen lax about his knees, when a
sudden cry called him to his feet. It was a strange sound,
thin and brief; it fell dead, and silence returned as though
it had never been interrupted. He had not recognised the
Doctor&rsquo;s voice; but, as there was no one else in all the
valley, it was plainly the Doctor who had given utterance
to the sound. He looked right and left, and there was
Desprez, standing in a niche between two boulders, and
looking round on his adopted son with a countenance as
white as paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A viper!&rdquo; cried Jean-Marie, running towards him.
&ldquo;A viper! You are bitten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor came down heavily out of the cleft, and advanced
in silence to meet the boy, whom he took roughly by
the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found it,&rdquo; he said, with a gasp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A plant?&rdquo; asked Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>Desprez had a fit of unnatural gaiety, which the rocks
took up and mimicked. &ldquo;A plant!&rdquo; he repeated scornfully.
&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;a plant. And here,&rdquo; he added suddenly,
showing his right hand, which he had hitherto concealed
behind his back&mdash;&ldquo;here is one of the bulbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean-Marie saw a dirty platter, coated with earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is a plate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a coach and horses,&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo;
he continued, growing warmer, &ldquo;I plucked away a great
pad of moss from between these boulders, and disclosed a
crevice; and when I looked in, what do you suppose I saw?
I saw a house in Paris with a court and garden, I saw my
wife shining with diamonds, I saw myself a deputy, I saw
you&mdash;well, I&mdash;I saw your future,&rdquo; he concluded, rather
feebly. &ldquo;I have just discovered America,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; asked the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Treasure of Franchard,&rdquo; cried the Doctor; and,
throwing his brown straw hat upon the ground, he whooped
like an Indian and sprang upon Jean-Marie, whom he suffocated
with embraces and bedewed with tears. Then he
flung himself down among the heather and once more
laughed until the valley rang.</p>

<p>But the boy had now an interest of his own, a boy&rsquo;s
interest. No sooner was he released from the Doctor&rsquo;s
accolade than he ran to the boulders, sprang into the niche,
and, thrusting his hand into the crevice, drew forth one after
another, encrusted with the earth of ages, the flagons,
candlesticks, and patens of the hermitage of Franchard. A
casket came last, tightly shut and very heavy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh what fun!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>But when he looked back at the Doctor, who had followed
close behind and was silently observing, the words died from
his lips. Desprez was once more the colour of ashes; his
lip worked and trembled; a sort of bestial greed possessed
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is childish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We lose precious time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Back to the inn, harness the trap, and bring it to yon bank.
Run for your life, and remember&mdash;not one whisper. I stay
here to watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean-Marie did as he was bid, though not without surprise.
The noddy was brought round to the spot indicated;
and the two gradually transported the treasure from its
place of concealment to the boot below the driving-seat.
Once it was all stored the Doctor recovered his gaiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pay my grateful duties to the genius of this dell,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Oh for a live coal, a heifer, and a jar of country
wine! I am in the vein for sacrifice, for a superb libation.
Well, and why not? We are at Franchard. English pale
ale is to be had&mdash;not classical, indeed, but excellent. Boy,
we shall drink ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought it was so unwholesome,&rdquo; said Jean-Marie,
&ldquo;and very dear besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee!&rdquo; exclaimed the Doctor gaily. &ldquo;To
the inn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he stepped into the noddy, tossing his head with an
elastic, youthful air. The horse was turned, and in a
few seconds they drew up beside the palings of the inn
garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Desprez&mdash;&ldquo;here, near the table, so that
we may keep an eye upon things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They tied the horse, and entered the garden, the Doctor
singing, now in fantastic high notes, now producing deep
reverberations from his chest. He took a seat, rapped loudly
on the table, assailed the waiter with witticisms; and when
the bottle of Bass was at length produced, far more charged
with gas than the most delirious champagne, he filled out a
long glassful of froth and pushed it over to Jean-Marie.
&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;drink deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not,&rdquo; faltered the boy, true to his
training.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; thundered Desprez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid of it,&rdquo; said Jean-Marie: &ldquo;my stomach&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it or leave it,&rdquo; interrupted Desprez fiercely:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
&ldquo;but understand it once for all&mdash;there is nothing so contemptible
as a precisian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was a new lesson! The boy sat bemused, looking
at the glass but not tasting it, while the Doctor emptied and
refilled his own, at first with clouded brow, but gradually
yielding to the sun, the heady, prickling beverage, and his
own predisposition to be happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once in a way,&rdquo; he said at last, by way of a concession
to the boy&rsquo;s more rigorous attitude, &ldquo;once in a way, and at
so critical a moment, this ale is a nectar for the gods. The
habit, indeed, is debasing; wine, the juice of the grape, is
the true drink of the Frenchman, as I have often had occasion
to point out; and I do not know that I can blame you
for refusing this outlandish stimulant. You can have some
wine and cakes. Is the bottle empty? Well, we will not be
proud; we will have pity on your glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beer being done, the Doctor chafed bitterly while
Jean-Marie finished his cakes. &ldquo;I burn to be gone,&rdquo; he
said, looking at his watch. &ldquo;Good God, how slow you eat!&rdquo;
And yet to eat slowly was his own particular prescription,
the main secret of longevity!</p>

<p>His martyrdom, however, reached an end at last; the
pair resumed their places in the buggy, and Desprez, leaning
luxuriously back, announced his intention of proceeding
to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Fontainebleau?&rdquo; repeated Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My words are always measured,&rdquo; said the Doctor.
&ldquo;On!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor was driven through the glades of paradise;
the air, the light, the shining leaves, the very movements of
the vehicle, seemed to fall in tune with his golden meditations;
with his head thrown back, he dreamed a series of
sunny visions, ale and pleasure dancing in his veins. At last
he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall telegraph for Casimir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good
Casimir! a fellow of the lower order of intelligence, Jean-Marie,
distinctly not creative, not poetic; and yet he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
repay your study; his fortune is vast, and is entirely due to
his own exertions. He is the very fellow to help us to dispose
of our trinkets, find us a suitable house in Paris, and
manage the details of our installation. Admirable Casimir,
one of my oldest comrades! It was on his advice, I may
add, that I invested my little fortune in Turkish bonds;
when we have added these spoils of the medi&aelig;val Church to
our stake in the Mahometan empire, little boy, we shall
positively roll among doubloons, positively roll!&mdash;Beautiful
forest,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;farewell! Though called to other scenes,
I will not forget thee. Thy name is graven in my heart.
Under the influence of prosperity I become dithyrambic,
Jean-Marie. Such is the impulse of the natural soul; such
was the constitution of prim&aelig;val man. And I&mdash;well, I will
not refuse the credit&mdash;I have preserved my youth like a
virginity; another, who should have led the same snoozing,
countrified existence for these years, another had become
rusty, become stereotype; but I, I praise my happy constitution,
retain the spring unbroken. Fresh opulence and
a new sphere of duties find me unabated in ardour and only
more mature by knowledge. For this prospective change,
Jean-Marie&mdash;it may probably have shocked you. Tell me
now, did it not strike you as an inconsistency? Confess&mdash;it
is useless to dissemble&mdash;it pained you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; returned the Doctor, with sublime fatuity,
&ldquo;I read your thoughts! Nor am I surprised&mdash;your education
is not yet complete; the higher duties of men have not
been yet presented to you fully. A hint&mdash;till we have
leisure&mdash;must suffice. Now that I am once more in possession
of a modest competence; now that I have so long prepared
myself in silent meditation, it becomes my superior
duty to proceed to Paris. My scientific training, my undoubted
command of language, mark me out for the service
of my country. Modesty in such a case would be a snare.
If sin were a philosophical expression, I should call it sinful.
A man must not deny his manifest abilities, for that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
evade his obligations. I must be up and doing; I must be
no skulker in life&rsquo;s battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he rattled on, copiously greasing the joint of his inconsistency
with words; while the boy listened silently, his
eyes fixed on the horse, his mind seething. It was all lost
eloquence; no array of words could unsettle a belief of
Jean-Marie&rsquo;s; and he drove into Fontainebleau filled with
pity, horror, indignation, and despair.</p>

<p>In the town Jean-Marie was kept a fixture on the driving-seat,
to guard the treasure; while the Doctor, with a singular,
slightly tipsy airiness of manner, fluttered in and out of
caf&eacute;s, where he shook hands with garrison officers, and mixed
an absinthe with the nicety of old experience; in and out of
shops, from which he returned laden with costly fruits, real
turtle, a magnificent piece of silk for his wife, a preposterous
cane for himself, and a k&eacute;pi of the newest fashion for the boy;
in and out of the telegraph office, whence he despatched his
telegram, and where three hours later he received an answer
promising a visit on the morrow, and generally pervaded
Fontainebleau with the first fine aroma of his divine good-humour.</p>

<p>The sun was very low when they set forth again; the
shadows of the forest trees extended across the broad white
road that led them home; the penetrating odour of the evening
wood had already arisen, like a cloud of incense, from
that broad field of tree-tops; and even in the streets of the
town, where the air had been baked all day between white
walls, it came in whiffs and pulses, like a distant music.
Half-way home, the last gold flicker vanished from a great
oak upon the left; and when they came forth beyond the
borders of the wood, the plain was already sunken in pearly
greyness, and a great, pale moon came swinging skyward
through the filmy poplars.</p>

<p>The Doctor sang, the Doctor whistled, the Doctor talked.
He spoke of the woods, and the wars, and the deposition of
dew; he brightened and babbled of Paris; he soared into
cloudy bombast on the glories of the political arena. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
was to be changed; as the day departed, it took with it the
vestiges of an outworn existence, and to-morrow&rsquo;s sun was
to inaugurate the new. &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;of this life
of maceration!&rdquo; His wife (still beautiful, or he was sadly
partial) was to be no longer buried; she should now shine
before society. Jean-Marie would find the world at his
feet; the roads open to success, wealth, honour, and
posthumous renown. &ldquo;And oh, by the way,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for
God&rsquo;s sake keep your tongue quiet! You are, of course, a
very silent fellow; it is a quality I gladly recognise in you&mdash;silence,
golden silence! But this is a matter of gravity. No
word must get abroad; none but the good Casimir is to be
trusted; we shall probably dispose of the vessels in
England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are they not even ours?&rdquo; the boy said, almost
with a sob&mdash;it was the only time he had spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours in this sense, that they are nobody else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied
the Doctor. &ldquo;But the State would have some claim. If
they were stolen, for instance, we should be unable to demand
their restitution; we should have no title; we should
be unable even to communicate with the police. Such is
the monstrous condition of the law.<a name="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">[2]</span></a> It is a mere instance
of what remains to be done, of the injustices that may yet
be righted by an ardent, active, and philosophical deputy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean-Marie put his faith in Madame Desprez; and as
they drove forward down the road from Bourron, between
the rustling poplars, he prayed in his teeth, and whipped up
the horse to an unusual speed. Surely, as soon as they
arrived, madame would assert her character, and bring this
waking nightmare to an end.</p>

<p>Their entrance into Gretz was heralded and accompanied
by a most furious barking; all the dogs in the village seemed
to smell the treasure in the noddy. But there was no one in
the street, save three lounging landscape-painters at Tentaillon&rsquo;s
door. Jean-Marie opened the green gate and led
in the horse and carriage; and almost at the same moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Madame Desprez came to the kitchen threshold with a
lighted lantern; for the moon was not yet high enough to
clear the garden walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close the gates, Jean-Marie!&rdquo; cried the Doctor, somewhat
unsteadily alighting.&mdash;&ldquo;Anastasie, where is Aline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has gone to Montereau to see her parents,&rdquo; said
madame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All is for the best!&rdquo; exclaimed the Doctor fervently.
&ldquo;Here quick, come near to me; I do not wish to speak too
loud,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Darling, we are wealthy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wealthy!&rdquo; repeated the wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found the treasure of Franchard,&rdquo; replied her
husband, &ldquo;See, here are the first-fruits; a pine-apple, a
dress for my ever-beautiful&mdash;it will suit her&mdash;trust a husband&rsquo;s,
trust a lover&rsquo;s taste! Embrace me, darling! This
grimy episode is over; the butterfly unfolds its painted
wings. To-morrow Casimir will come; in a week we may
be in Paris&mdash;happy at last! You shall have diamonds.&mdash;Jean-Marie,
take it out of the boot, with religious care, and
bring it piece by piece into the dining-room. We shall have
plate at table! Darling, hasten and prepare this turtle; it will
be a whet&mdash;it will be an addition to our meagre ordinary. I
myself will proceed to the cellar. We shall have a bottle of
that little Beaujolais you like, and finish with the Hermitage;
there are still three bottles left. Worthy wine for a
worthy occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my husband, you put me in a whirl,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I do not comprehend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The turtle, my adored, the turtle!&rdquo; cried the Doctor;
and he pushed her towards the kitchen, lantern and all.</p>

<p>Jean-Marie stood dumfoundered. He had pictured to
himself a different scene&mdash;a more immediate protest, and
his hope began to dwindle on the spot.</p>

<p>The Doctor was everywhere, a little doubtful on his legs,
perhaps, and now and then taking the wall with his shoulder;
for it was long since he had tasted absinthe, and he was even
then reflecting that the absinthe had been a misconception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Not that he regretted excess on such a glorious day, but he
made a mental memorandum to beware; he must not, a
second time, become the victim of a deleterious habit. He
had his wine out of the cellar in a twinkling; he arranged the
sacrificial vessels, some on the white table-cloth, some on the
sideboard, still crusted with historic earth. He was in and
out of the kitchen, plying Anastasie with vermouth, heating
her with glimpses of the future, estimating their new wealth
at ever larger figures; and before they sat down to supper,
the lady&rsquo;s virtue had melted in the fire of his enthusiasm, her
timidity had disappeared; she, too, had begun to speak disparagingly
of the life at Gretz; and as she took her place and
helped the soup, her eyes shone with the glitter of prospective
diamonds.</p>

<p>All through the meal she and the Doctor made and unmade
fairy plans. They bobbed and bowed and pledged
each other. Their faces ran over with smiles; their eyes
scattered sparkles, as they projected the Doctor&rsquo;s political
honours and the lady&rsquo;s drawing-room ovations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will not be a Red!&rdquo; cried Anastasie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Left Centre to the core,&rdquo; replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Gastein will present us&mdash;we shall find ourselves
forgotten,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; protested the Doctor. &ldquo;Beauty and talent
leave a mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have positively forgotten how to dress,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darling, you make me blush,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Yours has
been a tragic marriage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your success&mdash;to see you appreciated, honoured,
your name in all the papers, that will be more than pleasure&mdash;it
will be heaven!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And once a week,&rdquo; said the Doctor, archly scanning
the syllables, &ldquo;once a week&mdash;one good little game of
baccarat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only once a week?&rdquo; she questioned, threatening him
with a finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it by my political honour,&rdquo; cried he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I spoil you,&rdquo; she said, and gave him her hand.</p>

<p>He covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>Jean-Marie escaped into the night. The moon swung
high over Gretz. He went down to the garden end and sat
on the jetty. The river ran by with eddies of oily silver,
and a low monotonous song. Faint veils of mist moved
among the poplars on the farther side. The reeds were
quietly nodding. A hundred times already had the boy
sat, on such a night, and watched the streaming river with
untroubled fancy. And this perhaps was to be the last.
He was to leave this familiar hamlet, this green, rustling
country, this bright and quiet stream; he was to pass into the
great city; his dear lady mistress was to move bedizened in
saloons; his good, garrulous, kind-hearted master to become
a brawling deputy; and both be lost for ever to Jean-Marie
and their better selves. He knew his own defects; he knew
he must sink into less and less consideration in the turmoil
of a city life, sink more and more from the child into the
servant. And he began dimly to believe the Doctor&rsquo;s prophecies
of evil. He could see a change in both. His generous incredulity
failed him for this once; a child must have perceived
that the Hermitage had completed what the absinthe had
begun. If this were the first day, what would be the last?
&ldquo;If necessary, wreck the train,&rdquo; thought he, remembering
the Doctor&rsquo;s parable. He looked round on the delightful
scene; he drank deep of the charmed night-air, laden with
the scent of hay. &ldquo;If necessary, wreck the train,&rdquo; he repeated.
And he rose and returned to the house.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, IN TWO PARTS</h5>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning there was a most unusual outcry in the
Doctor&rsquo;s house. The last thing before going to bed, the
Doctor had locked up some valuables in the dining-room
cupboard; and behold, when he rose again, as he did about
four o&rsquo;clock, the cupboard had been broken open, and the
valuables in question had disappeared. Madame and Jean-Marie
were summoned from their rooms, and appeared in
hasty toilets; they found the Doctor raving, calling the
heavens to witness and avenge his injury, pacing the room
barefooted, with the tails of his night-shirt flirting as he turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the things are gone, the fortune
gone! We are paupers once more. Boy! what do you
know of this? Speak up, sir, speak up. Do you know of
it? Where are they?&rdquo; He had him by the arm, shaking
him like a bag, and the boy&rsquo;s words, if he had any, were
jolted forth in inarticulate murmurs. The Doctor, with a
revulsion from his own violence, set him down again. He
observed Anastasie in tears. &ldquo;Anastasie,&rdquo; he said, in
quite an altered voice, &ldquo;compose yourself, command your
feelings. I would not have you give way to passion like
the vulgar. This&mdash;this trifling accident must be lived
down.&mdash;Jean-Marie, bring me my smaller medicine-chest.
A gentle laxative is indicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he dosed the family all round, leading the way himself
with a double quantity. The wretched Anastasie,
who had never been ill in the whole course of her existence,
and whose soul recoiled from remedies, wept floods of tears
as she sipped, and shuddered, and protested, and then was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
bullied and shouted at until she sipped again. As for Jean-Marie,
he took his portion down with stoicism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have given him a less amount,&rdquo; observed the Doctor,
&ldquo;his youth protecting him against emotion. And now
that we have thus parried any morbid consequences, let us
reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so cold,&rdquo; wailed Anastasie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cold!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;I give thanks to God that
I am made of fierier material. Why, madam, a blow like
this would set a frog into a transpiration. If you are cold,
you can retire; and, by the way, you might throw me down
my trousers. It is chilly for the legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; protested Anastasie; &ldquo;I will stay with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam, you shall not suffer for your devotion,&rdquo;
said the Doctor. &ldquo;I will myself fetch you a shawl.&rdquo; And
he went upstairs and returned more fully clad and with an
armful of wraps for the shivering Anastasie. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo;
he resumed, &ldquo;to investigate this crime. Let us proceed by
induction. Anastasie, do you know anything that can help
us?&rdquo; Anastasie knew nothing. &ldquo;Or you, Jean-Marie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied the boy steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; returned the Doctor. &ldquo;We shall now turn
our attention to the material evidences. (I was born to be
a detective; I have the eye and the systematic spirit.)
First, violence has been employed. The door was broken
open; and it may be observed, in passing, that the lock was
dear indeed at what I paid for it: a crow to pluck with
Master Goguelat. Second, here is the instrument employed,
one of our own table-knives, one of our best, my
dear; which seems to indicate no preparation on the part
of the gang&mdash;if gang it was. Thirdly, I observe that nothing
has been removed except the Franchard dishes and the
casket; our own silver has been minutely respected. This
is wily; it shows intelligence, a knowledge of the code, a
desire to avoid legal consequences. I argue from this fact
that the gang numbers persons of respectability&mdash;outward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
of course, and merely outward, as the robbery proves. But I
argue, second, that we must have been observed at Franchard
itself by some occult observer, and dogged throughout
the day with a skill and patience that I venture to qualify
as consummate. No ordinary man, no occasional criminal,
would have shown himself capable of this combination.
We have in our neighbourhood, it is far from improbable,
a retired bandit of the highest order of intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heaven!&rdquo; cried the horrified Anastasie.
&ldquo;Henri, how can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cherished one, this is a process of induction,&rdquo; said
the Doctor. &ldquo;If any of my steps are unsound, correct me.
You are silent? Then do not, I beseech you, be so vulgarly
illogical as to revolt from my conclusion. We have now
arrived,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;at some idea of the composition of
the gang&mdash;for I incline to the hypothesis of more than one&mdash;and
we now leave this room, which can disclose no more,
and turn our attention to the court and garden. (Jean-Marie,
I trust you are observantly following my various
steps; this is an excellent piece of education for you.)
Come with me to the door. No steps on the court; it is unfortunate
our court should be paved. On what small
matters hang the destiny of these delicate investigations!
Hey! What have we here? I have led you to the very
spot,&rdquo; he said, standing grandly backward and indicating
the green gate. &ldquo;An escalade, as you can now see for yourselves,
has taken place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the green paint was in several places
scratched and broken; and one of the panels preserved
the print of a nailed shoe. The foot had slipped, however,
and it was difficult to estimate the size of the shoe, and impossible
to distinguish the pattern of the nails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole robbery,&rdquo; concluded the Doctor, &ldquo;step by
step, has been reconstituted. Inductive science can no
further go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;You should indeed
have been a detective, Henri. I had no idea of your talents.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied Desprez condescendingly, &ldquo;a man
of scientific imagination combines the lesser faculties; he is
a detective just as he is a publicist or a general; these are
but local applications of his special talent. But now,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;would you have me go further? Would you
have me lay my finger on the culprits&mdash;or rather, for I cannot
promise quite so much, point out to you the very house
where they consort? It may be a satisfaction, at least it is all
we are likely to get, since we are denied the remedy of law.
I reach the further stage in this way. In order to fill my
outline of the robbery, I require a man likely to be in the
forest idling, I require a man of education, I require a man
superior to considerations of morality. The three requisites
all centre in Tentaillon&rsquo;s boarders. They are painters,
therefore they are continually lounging in the forest. They
are painters, therefore they are not unlikely to have some
smattering of education. Lastly, because they are painters,
they are probably immoral. And this I prove in two ways.
First, painting is an art which merely addresses the eye; it
does not in any particular exercise the moral sense. And
second, painting, in common with all the other arts, implies
the dangerous quality of imagination. A man of imagination
is never moral; he outsoars literal demarcations
and reviews life under too many shifting lights to
rest content with the invidious distinctions of the
law!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you always say&mdash;at least, so I understood you&rdquo;&mdash;said
madame, &ldquo;that these lads display no imagination
whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, they displayed imagination, and of a very
fantastic order too,&rdquo; returned the Doctor, &ldquo;when they embraced
their beggarly profession. Besides&mdash;and this is an
argument exactly suited to your intellectual level&mdash;many
of them are English and American. Where else should we
expect to find a thief?&mdash;And now you had better get your
coffee. Because we have lost a treasure, there is no reason
for starving. For my part, I shall break my fast with white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
wine. I feel unaccountably heated and thirsty to-day. I
can only attribute it to the shock of the discovery. And
yet, you will bear me out, I supported the emotion nobly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor had now talked himself back into an admirable
humour; and as he sat in the arbour and slowly imbibed
a large allowance of white wine and picked a little
bread and cheese with no very impetuous appetite, if a third
of his meditations ran upon the missing treasure, the other
two-thirds were more pleasingly busied in the retrospect of
his detective skill.</p>

<p>About eleven Casimir arrived; he had caught an early
train to Fontainebleau, and driven over, to save time; and
now his cab was stabled at Tentaillon&rsquo;s, and he remarked,
studying his watch, that he could spare an hour and a half.
He was much the man of business, decisively spoken, given
to frowning in an intellectual manner. Anastasie&rsquo;s born
brother, he did not waste much sentiment on the lady,
gave her an English family kiss, and demanded a meal
without delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can tell me your story while we eat,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;Anything good to-day, Stasie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was promised something good. The trio sat down to
table in the arbour, Jean-Marie waiting as well as eating,
and the Doctor recounted what had happened in his richest
narrative manner. Casimir heard it with explosions of
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a streak of luck for you, my good brother,&rdquo; he
observed, when the tale was over. &ldquo;If you had gone to
Paris, you would have played dick-duck-drake with the
whole consignment in three months. Your own would have
followed; and you would have come to me in a procession
like the last time. But I give you warning&mdash;Stasie may weep
and Henri ratiocinate&mdash;it will not serve you twice. Your
next collapse will be fatal. I thought I had told you so,
Stasie? Hey? No sense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor winced and looked furtively at Jean-Marie;
but the boy seemed apathetic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And then again,&rdquo; broke out Casimir, &ldquo;what children
you are&mdash;vicious children, my faith! How could you tell
the value of this trash? It might have been worth nothing,
or next door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;You have your usual
flow of spirits, I perceive, but even less than your usual
deliberation. I am not entirely ignorant of these matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not entirely ignorant of anything ever I heard of,&rdquo;
interrupted Casimir, bowing, and raising his glass with a
sort of pert politeness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; resumed the Doctor, &ldquo;I gave my mind to
the subject&mdash;that you may be willing to believe&mdash;and I
estimated that our capital would be doubled.&rdquo; And he
described the nature of the find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My word of honour!&rdquo; said Casimir, &ldquo;I half believe
you! But much would depend on the quality of the gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The quality, my dear Casimir, was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And the
Doctor, in default of language, kissed his finger-tips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not take your word for it, my good friend,&rdquo;
retorted the man of business. &ldquo;You are a man of very
rosy views. But this robbery,&rdquo; he continued&mdash;&ldquo;this
robbery is an odd thing. Of course I pass over your nonsense
about gangs and landscape-painters. For me, that
is a dream. Who was in the house last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None but ourselves,&rdquo; replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this young gentleman?&rdquo; asked Casimir, jerking
a nod in the direction of Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He too&rdquo;&mdash;the Doctor bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; and, if it is a fair question, who is he?&rdquo; pursued
the brother-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean-Marie,&rdquo; answered the Doctor, &ldquo;combines the
functions of a son and stable-boy. He began as the latter,
but he rose rapidly to the more honourable rank in our
affections. He is, I may say, the greatest comfort in our
lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Casimir. &ldquo;And previous to becoming one
of you?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean-Marie has lived a remarkable existence; his experience
has been eminently formative,&rdquo; replied Desprez.
&ldquo;If I had had to choose an education for my son, I should
have chosen such another. Beginning life with mountebanks
and thieves, passing onward to the society and
friendship of philosophers, he may be said to have skimmed
the volume of human life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thieves?&rdquo; repeated the brother-in-law, with a meditative
air.</p>

<p>The Doctor could have bitten his tongue out. He foresaw
what was coming, and prepared his mind for a vigorous
defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever steal yourself?&rdquo; asked Casimir, turning
suddenly on Jean-Marie, and for the first time employing a
single eyeglass which hung round his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the boy, with a deep blush.</p>

<p>Casimir turned to the others with pursed lips, and
nodded to them meaningly. &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;how is
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean-Marie is a teller of the truth,&rdquo; returned the
Doctor, throwing out his bust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has never told a lie,&rdquo; added madame. &ldquo;He is the
best of boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never told a lie, has he not?&rdquo; reflected Casimir.
&ldquo;Strange, very strange. Give me your attention, my
young friend,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You knew about this
treasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He helped to bring it home,&rdquo; interposed the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Desprez, I ask you nothing but to hold your tongue,&rdquo;
returned Casimir. &ldquo;I mean to question this stable-boy of
yours; and if you are so certain of his innocence, you can
afford to let him answer for himself.&mdash;Now, sir,&rdquo; he resumed,
pointing his eyeglass straight at Jean-Marie. &ldquo;You knew
it could be stolen with impunity? You knew you could not
be prosecuted? Come! Did you, or did you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered Jean-Marie, in a miserable whisper.
He sat there changing colour like a revolving pharos, twist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>ing
his fingers hysterically, swallowing air, the picture of
guilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew where it was put?&rdquo; resumed the inquisitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; from Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you have been a thief before,&rdquo; continued
Casimir. &ldquo;Now, how am I to know that you are not one
still? I suppose you could climb the green gate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; still lower, from the culprit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it was you who stole these things. You
know it, and you dare not deny it. Look me in the face!
Raise your sneak&rsquo;s eyes, and answer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in place of anything of that sort Jean-Marie broke
into a dismal howl and fled from the arbour. Anastasie, as
she pursued to capture and reassure the victim, found time
to send one Parthian arrow&mdash;&ldquo;Casimir, you are a brute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; said Desprez, with the greatest dignity,
&ldquo;you take upon yourself a licence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Desprez,&rdquo; interrupted Casimir, &ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake be
a man of the world. You telegraph me to leave my business
and come down here on yours. I come, I ask the business,
you say, &lsquo;Find me this thief!&rsquo; Well, I find him; I say
&lsquo;There he is!&rsquo; You need not like it, but you have no
manner of right to take offence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the Doctor, &ldquo;I grant that; I will even
thank you for your mistaken zeal. But your hypothesis
was so extravagantly monstrous&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; interrupted Casimir; &ldquo;was it you or
Stasie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; answered the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; then it was the boy. Say no more about
it,&rdquo; said the brother-in-law, and he produced his cigar-case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will say this much more,&rdquo; returned Desprez: &ldquo;if
that boy came and told me so himself, I should not believe
him; and if I did believe him, so implicit is my trust, I
should conclude that he had acted for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Casimir indulgently. &ldquo;Have you a
light? I must be going. And by the way, I wish you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
let me sell your Turks for you. I always told you, it meant
smash. I tell you so again. Indeed, it was partly that which
brought me down. You never acknowledge my letters&mdash;a
most unpardonable habit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good brother,&rdquo; replied the Doctor blandly, &ldquo;I
have never denied your ability in business; but I can perceive
your limitations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad, my friend, I can return the compliment,&rdquo; observed
the man of business. &ldquo;Your limitation is to be
downright irrational.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Observe the relative position,&rdquo; returned the Doctor,
with a smile. &ldquo;It is your attitude to believe through thick
and thin in one man&rsquo;s judgment&mdash;your own. I follow the
same opinion, but critically and with open eyes. Which is
the more irrational? I leave it to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow!&rdquo; cried Casimir, &ldquo;stick to your
Turks, stick to your stable-boy, go to the devil in general in
your own way and be done with it. But don&rsquo;t ratiocinate
with me&mdash;I cannot bear it. And so, ta-ta. I might as well
have stayed away for any good I&rsquo;ve done. Say good-bye
from me to Stasie, and to the sullen hang-dog of a stable-boy,
if you insist on it; I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Casimir departed. The Doctor, that night, dissected
his character before Anastasie. &ldquo;One thing, my
beautiful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he has learned one thing from his lifelong
acquaintance with your husband: the word <i>ratiocinate</i>.
It shines in his vocabulary like a jewel in a muck-heap.
And, even so, he continually misapplies it. For you must
have observed he uses it as a sort of taunt, in the sense of
<i>to ergotise</i>, implying, as it were&mdash;the poor, dear fellow!&mdash;a
vein of sophistry. As for his cruelty to Jean-Marie, it must
be forgiven him&mdash;it is not his nature, it is the nature of his
life. A man who deals with money, my dear, is a man
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Jean-Marie the process of reconciliation had been
somewhat slow. At first he was inconsolable, insisted on
leaving the family, went from paroxysm to paroxysm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
tears; and it was only after Anastasie had been closeted for
an hour with him, alone, that she came forth, sought out the
Doctor, and, with tears in her eyes, acquainted that gentleman
with what had passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first, my husband, he would hear of nothing,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Imagine! if he had left us! what would the treasure be
to that? Horrible treasure, it has brought all this about! At
last, after he has sobbed his very heart out, he agrees to stay
on a condition&mdash;we are not to mention this matter, this infamous
suspicion, not even to mention the robbery. On that
agreement only, the poor, cruel boy will consent to remain
among his friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this inhibition,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;this embargo&mdash;it
cannot possibly apply to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To all of us,&rdquo; Anastasie assured him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cherished one,&rdquo; Desprez protested, &ldquo;you must
have misunderstood. It cannot apply to me. He would
naturally come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henri,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it does; I swear to you it does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a painful, a very painful circumstance,&rdquo; the
Doctor said, looking a little black. &ldquo;I cannot affect,
Anastasie, to be anything but justly wounded. I feel this&mdash;I
feel it, my wife, acutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But if you had seen
his distress! We must make allowances, we must sacrifice
our feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust, my dear, you have never found me averse to
sacrifices,&rdquo; said the Doctor very stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will let me go and tell him that you have
agreed? It will be like your noble nature,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>So it would, he perceived&mdash;it would be like his noble
nature! Up jumped his spirits, triumphant at the thought.
&ldquo;Go, darling,&rdquo; he said nobly, &ldquo;reassure him. The subject
is buried; more&mdash;I make an effort, I have accustomed my
will to these exertions&mdash;and it is forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little after, but still with swollen eyes and looking
mortally sheepish, Jean-Marie reappeared and went osten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>tatiously
about his business. He was the only unhappy
member of the party that sat down that night to supper.
As for the Doctor, he was radiant. He then sang the requiem
of the treasure:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This has been, on the whole, a most amusing episode,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We are not a penny the worse&mdash;nay, we are immensely
gainers. Our philosophy has been exercised;
some of the turtle is still left&mdash;the most wholesome of delicacies;
I have my staff, Anastasie has her new dress, Jean-Marie
is the proud possessor of a fashionable k&eacute;pi. Besides,
we had a glass of Hermitage last night; the glow still suffuses
my memory. I was growing positively niggardly with that
Hermitage, positively niggardly. Let me take the hint:
we had one bottle to celebrate the appearance of our visionary
fortune; let us have a second to console us for its occultation.
The third I hereby dedicate to Jean-Marie&rsquo;s wedding
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF DESPREZ</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Doctor&rsquo;s house has not yet received the compliment
of a description, and it is now high time that the omission
were supplied, for the house is itself an actor in the story,
and one whose part is nearly at an end. Two stories in
height, walls of a warm yellow, tiles of an ancient ruddy
brown diversified with moss and lichen, it stood with one
wall to the street in the angle of the Doctor&rsquo;s property. It
was roomy, draughty, and inconvenient. The large rafters
were here and there engraven with rude marks and patterns;
the hand-rail of the stair was carved in countrified arabesque;
a stout timber pillar, which did duty to support
the dining-room roof, bore mysterious characters on its
darker side, runes, according to the Doctor; nor did he
fail, when he ran over the legendary history of the house and
its possessors, to dwell upon the Scandinavian scholar who
had left them. Floors, doors, and rafters made a great
variety of angles; every room had a particular inclination;
the gable had tilted towards the garden, after the manner
of a leaning tower, and one of the former proprietors had
buttressed the building from that side with a great strut
of wood, like the derrick of a crane. Altogether, it had
many marks of ruin; it was a house for the rats to desert;
and nothing but its excellent brightness&mdash;the window-glass
polished and shining, the paint well scoured, the brasses
radiant, the very prop all wreathed about with climbing
flowers&mdash;nothing but its air of a well-tended, smiling
veteran, sitting, crutch and all, in the sunny corner of a
garden, marked it as a house for comfortable people to
inhabit. In poor or idle management it would soon have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
hurried into the blackguard stages of decay. As it was,
the whole family loved it, and the Doctor was never better
inspired than when he narrated its imaginary story and
drew the character of its successive masters, from the
Hebrew merchant who had re-edified its walls after the
sack of the town, and past the mysterious engraver of the
runes, down to the long-headed, dirty-handed boor from
whom he had himself acquired it at a ruinous expense. As
for any alarm about its security, the idea had never presented
itself. What had stood four centuries might well
endure a little longer.</p>

<p>Indeed, in this particular winter, after the finding and
losing of the treasure, the Desprez had an anxiety of a very
different order, and one which lay nearer their hearts. Jean-Marie
was plainly not himself. He had fits of hectic activity,
when he made unusual exertions to please, spoke more
and faster, and redoubled in attention to his lessons. But
these were interrupted by spells of melancholia and brooding
silence, when the boy was little better than unbearable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; the Doctor moralised&mdash;&ldquo;you see, Anastasie,
what comes of silence. Had the boy properly unbosomed
himself, the little disappointment about the treasure, the
little annoyance about Casimir&rsquo;s incivility, would long ago
have been forgotten. As it is, they prey upon him like a
disease. He loses flesh, his appetite is variable and, on
the whole, impaired. I keep him on the strictest regimen,
I exhibit the most powerful tonics; both in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you drug him too much?&rdquo; asked
madame, with an irrepressible shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drug?&rdquo; cried the Doctor; &ldquo;I drug? Anastasie, you
are mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time went on, and the boy&rsquo;s health still slowly declined.
The Doctor blamed the weather, which was cold and
boisterous. He called in his <i>confr&egrave;re</i> from Bourron, took
a fancy for him, magnified his capacity, and was pretty
soon under treatment himself&mdash;it scarcely appeared for
what complaint. He and Jean-Marie had each medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
to take at different periods of the day. The Doctor used
to lie in wait for the exact moment, watch in hand. &ldquo;There
is nothing like regularity,&rdquo; he would say, fill out the doses,
and dilate on the virtues of the draught; and if the boy
seemed none the better, the Doctor was not at all the worse.</p>

<p>Gunpowder Day, the boy was particularly low. It
was scowling, squally weather. Huge broken companies
of cloud sailed swiftly overhead; raking gleams of sunlight
swept the village, and were followed by intervals of darkness
and white, flying rain. At times the wind lifted up
its voice and bellowed. The trees were all scourging themselves
along the meadows, the last leaves flying like dust.</p>

<p>The Doctor, between the boy and the weather, was
in his element; he had a theory to prove. He sat with
his watch out and a barometer in front of him, waiting for
the squalls and noting their effect upon the human pulse.
&ldquo;For the true philosopher,&rdquo; he remarked delightedly,
&ldquo;every fact in nature is a toy.&rdquo; A letter came to him;
but, as its arrival coincided with the approach of another
gust, he merely crammed it into his pocket, gave the time
to Jean-Marie, and the next moment they were both counting
their pulses as if for a wager.</p>

<p>At nightfall the wind rose into a tempest. It besieged
the hamlet, apparently from every side, as if with batteries
of cannon; the houses shook and groaned; live coals were
blown upon the floor. The uproar and terror of the night
kept people long awake, sitting with pallid faces giving ear.</p>

<p>It was twelve before the Desprez family retired. By
half-past one, when the storm was already somewhat past
its height, the Doctor was awakened from a troubled
slumber, and sat up. A noise still rang in his ears, but
whether of this world or the world of dreams he was not
certain. Another clap of wind followed. It was accompanied
by a sickening movement of the whole house, and
in the subsequent lull Desprez could hear the tiles pouring
like a cataract into the loft above his head. He plucked
Anastasie bodily out of bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; he cried, thrusting some wearing apparel into
her hands; &ldquo;the house is falling! To the garden!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not pause to be twice bidden; she was down
the stair in an instant. She had never before suspected
herself of such activity. The Doctor meanwhile, with the
speed of a piece of pantomime business, and undeterred
by broken shins, proceeded to rout out Jean-Marie, tore
Aline from her virgin slumbers, seized her by the hand,
and tumbled downstairs and into the garden, with the girl
tumbling behind him, still not half awake.</p>

<p>The fugitives rendezvoused in the arbour by some
common instinct. Then came a bull&rsquo;s-eye flash of struggling
moonshine, which disclosed their four figures standing
huddled from the wind in a raffle of flying drapery, and not
without a considerable need for more. At the humiliating
spectacle Anastasie clutched her night-dress desperately
about her and burst loudly into tears. The Doctor flew
to console her; but she elbowed him away. She suspected
everybody of being the general public, and thought the
darkness was alive with eyes.</p>

<p>Another gleam and another violent gust arrived together;
the house was seen to rock on its foundation, and,
just as the light was once more eclipsed, a crash which
triumphed over the shouting of the wind announced its
fall, and for a moment the whole garden was alive with
skipping tiles and brickbats. One such missile grazed
the Doctor&rsquo;s ear; another descended on the bare foot of
Aline, who instantly made night hideous with her shrieks.</p>

<p>By this time the hamlet was alarmed, lights flashed
from the windows, hails reached the party, and the Doctor
answered, nobly contending against Aline and the tempest.
But this prospect of help only awakened Anastasie to a
more active stage of terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henri, people will be coming,&rdquo; she screamed in her
husband&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust so,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They cannot. I would rather die,&rdquo; she wailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the Doctor reprovingly, &ldquo;you are
excited. I gave you some clothes. What have you done
with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I must have thrown them away!
Where are they?&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>

<p>Desprez groped about in the darkness. &ldquo;Admirable!&rdquo;
he remarked; &ldquo;my grey velveteen trousers! This will
exactly meet your necessities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give them to me!&rdquo; she cried fiercely; but as soon
as she had them in her hands her mood appeared to alter&mdash;she
stood silent for a moment, and then pressed the garment
back upon the Doctor. &ldquo;Give it to Aline,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;poor
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Aline does not know
what she is about. Aline is beside herself with terror;
and, at any rate, she is a peasant. Now, I am really concerned
at this exposure for a person of your housekeeping
habits; my solicitude and your fantastic modesty both
point to the same remedy&mdash;the pantaloons.&rdquo; He held
them ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible. You do not understand,&rdquo; she said
with dignity.</p>

<p>By this time rescue was at hand. It had been found
impracticable to enter by the street, for the gate was blocked
with masonry, and the nodding ruin still threatened further
avalanches. But between the Doctor&rsquo;s garden and the
one on the right hand there was that very picturesque contrivance&mdash;a
common well; the door on the Desprez side
had chanced to be unbolted, and now, through the arched
aperture, a man&rsquo;s bearded face and an arm supporting a
lantern were introduced into the world of windy darkness,
where Anastasie concealed her woes. The light struck
here and there among the tossing apple boughs, it glinted
on the grass; but the lantern and the glowing face became
the centre of the world. Anastasie crouched back from the
intrusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; shouted the man. &ldquo;Are you all safe?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>Aline, still screaming, ran to the new-comer, and was
presently hauled head-foremost through the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Anastasie, come on; it is your turn,&rdquo; said the
husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we all to die of exposure, madame?&rdquo; thundered
Doctor Desprez.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, go, go away! I can
stay here; I am quite warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor took her by the shoulders with an oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I will put them on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took the detested lendings in her hand once more;
but her repulsion was stronger than shame. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
she cried, shuddering, and flung them far away into the
night.</p>

<p>Next moment the Doctor had whirled her to the well.
The man was there, and the lantern; Anastasie closed her
eyes and appeared to herself to be about to die. How she
was transported through the arch she knew not; but once
on the other side she was received by the neighbour&rsquo;s wife,
and enveloped in a friendly blanket.</p>

<p>Beds were made ready for the two women, clothes of
very various sizes for the Doctor and Jean-Marie; and for the
remainder of the night, while madame dozed in and out on
the borderland of hysterics, her husband sat beside the fire
and held forth to the admiring neighbours. He showed
them, at length, the causes of the accident; for years, he
explained, the fall had been impending; one sign had
followed another: the joints had opened, the plaster had
cracked, the old walls bowed inward; last, not three weeks
ago, the cellar-door had begun to work with difficulty in its
grooves. &ldquo;The cellar!&rdquo; he said, gravely shaking his head
over a glass of mulled wine. &ldquo;That reminds me of my poor
vintages. By a manifest providence the Hermitage was
nearly at an end. One bottle&mdash;I lose but one bottle of
that incomparable wine. It had been set apart against
Jean-Marie&rsquo;s wedding. Well, I must lay down some more;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
it will be an interest in life. I am, however, a man somewhat
advanced in years. My great work is now buried
in the fall of my humble roof; it will never be completed&mdash;my
name will have been writ in water. And yet you find
me calm&mdash;I would say cheerful. Can your priest do
more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the first glimpse of day the party sallied forth from
the fireside into the street. The wind had fallen, but still
charioted a world of troubled clouds; the air bit like frost;
and the party, as they stood about the ruins in the rainy
twilight of the morning, beat upon their breasts and blew
into their hands for warmth. The house had entirely
fallen, the walls outward, the roof in; it was a mere heap
of rubbish, with here and there a forlorn spear of broken
rafter. A sentinel was placed over the ruins to protect the
property, and the party adjourned to Tentaillon&rsquo;s to break
their fast at the Doctor&rsquo;s expense. The bottle circulated
somewhat freely; and before they left the table it had begun
to snow.</p>

<p>For three days the snow continued to fall, and the
ruins, covered with tarpaulin and watched by sentries,
were left undisturbed. The Desprez meanwhile had taken
up their abode at Tentaillon&rsquo;s. Madame spent her time
in the kitchen, concocting little delicacies, with the admiring
aid of Madame Tentaillon, or sitting by the fire in thoughtful
abstraction. The fall of the house affected her wonderfully
little; that blow had been parried by another; and in her
mind she was continually fighting over again the battle of
the trousers. Had she done right? Had she done wrong?
And now she would applaud her determination; and anon,
with a horrid flush of unavailing penitence, she would regret
the trousers. No juncture in her life had so much
exercised her judgment. In the meantime the Doctor had
become vastly pleased with his situation. Two of the
summer boarders still lingered behind the rest, prisoners
for lack of a remittance; they were both English, but one
of them spoke French pretty fluently, and was, besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
a humorous, agile-minded fellow, with whom the Doctor
could reason by the hour, secure of comprehension. Many
were the glasses they emptied, many the topics they discussed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anastasie,&rdquo; the Doctor said on the third morning,
&ldquo;take an example from your husband, from Jean-Marie!
The excitement has done more for the boy than all my
tonics, he takes his turn as sentry with positive gusto. As
for me, you behold me. I have made friends with the
Egyptians; and my Pharaoh is, I swear it, a most agreeable
companion. You alone are hipped. About a house&mdash;a
few dresses? What are they in comparison to the &lsquo;Pharmacop&oelig;ia&rsquo;&mdash;the
labour of years lying buried below stones
and sticks in this depressing hamlet? The snow falls; I
shake it from my cloak! Imitate me. Our income will be
impaired, I grant it, since we must rebuild; but moderation,
patience, and philosophy will gather about the hearth.
In the meanwhile, the Tentaillons are obliging; the table,
with your additions, will pass; only the wine is execrable&mdash;well,
I shall send for some to-day. My Pharaoh will be
gratified to drink a decent glass; aha! and I shall see if
he possesses that acme of organisation&mdash;a palate. If he
has a palate, he is perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henri,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head, &ldquo;you are a man;
you cannot understand my feelings; no woman could shake
off the memory of so public a humiliation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor could not restrain a titter. &ldquo;Pardon me,
darling,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but really, to the philosophical intelligence,
the incident appears so small a trifle. You
looked extremely well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henri!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I will say no more,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Though,
to be sure, if you had consented to indue&mdash;&mdash;<i>&Agrave; propos</i>,&rdquo;
he broke off, &ldquo;and my trousers! They are lying in the snow&mdash;my
favourite trousers!&rdquo; And he dashed in quest of
Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>Two hours afterwards the boy returned to the inn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
a spade under one arm and a curious sop of clothing under
the other.</p>

<p>The Doctor ruefully took it in his hands. &ldquo;They have
been!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their tense is past. Excellent pantaloons,
you are no more! Stay, something in the <span class="correction" title="no quotes in text">pocket,&rdquo;</span>
and he produced a piece of paper. &ldquo;A letter! ay, now I
mind me; it was received on the morning of the gale, when
I was absorbed in delicate investigations. It is still legible.
From poor dear Casimir! It is as well,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;that
I have educated him to patience. Poor Casimir and his
correspondence&mdash;his infinitesimal, timorous, idiotic correspondence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had by this time cautiously unfolded the wet letter;
but, as he bent himself to decipher the writing, a cloud
descended on his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bigre!</i>&rdquo; he cried, with a galvanic start.</p>

<p>And then the letter was whipped into the fire, and the
Doctor&rsquo;s cap was on his head in the turn of a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes! I can catch it, if I run,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;It is always late. I go to Paris. I shall telegraph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henri! what is wrong?&rdquo; cried his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ottoman Bonds!&rdquo; came from the disappearing
Doctor; and Anastasie and Jean-Marie were left face to
face with the wet trousers. Desprez had gone to Paris,
for the second time in seven years; he had gone to Paris
with a pair of wooden shoes, a knitted spencer, a black
blouse, a country nightcap, and twenty francs in his pocket.
The fall of the house was but a secondary marvel; the whole
world might have fallen and scarce left his family more
petrified.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>THE WAGES OF PHILOSOPHY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the next day, the Doctor, a mere spectre
of himself, was brought back in the custody of Casimir.
They found Anastasie and the boy sitting together by the
fire; and Desprez, who had exchanged his toilette for a
ready-made rig-out of poor materials, waved his hand as
he entered, and sank speechless on the nearest chair.
Madame turned direct to Casimir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Casimir, &ldquo;what have I told you all
along? It has come. It is a clean shave this time; so you
may as well bear up and make the best of it. House down,
too, eh? Bad luck, upon my soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we&mdash;are we&mdash;ruined?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>The Doctor stretched out his arms to her. &ldquo;Ruined,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;you are ruined by your sinister husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Casimir observed the consequent embrace through his
eyeglass; then he turned to Jean-Marie. &ldquo;You hear?&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;They are ruined; no more pickings, no more
house, no more fat cutlets. It strikes me, my friend, that
you had best be packing; the present speculation is about
worked out.&rdquo; And he nodded to him meaningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Desprez, springing up. &ldquo;Jean-Marie,
if you prefer to leave me, now that I am poor, you can go;
you shall receive your hundred francs, if so much remains
to me. But if you will consent to stay&rdquo;&mdash;the Doctor wept
a little&mdash;&ldquo;Casimir offers me a place&mdash;as clerk,&rdquo; he resumed.
&ldquo;The emoluments are slender, but they will be enough for
three. It is too much already to have lost my fortune;
must I lose my son?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>Jean-Marie sobbed bitterly, but without a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like boys who cry,&rdquo; observed Casimir. &ldquo;This
one is always crying.&mdash;Here! you clear out of this for a
little; I have business with your master and mistress, and
these domestic feelings may be settled after I am gone.
March!&rdquo; and he held the door open.</p>

<p>Jean-Marie slunk out, like a detected thief.</p>

<p>By twelve they were all at table but Jean-Marie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said Casimir. &ldquo;Gone, you see. Took the
hint at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not, I confess,&rdquo; said Desprez, &ldquo;I do not seek
to excuse his absence. It speaks a want of heart that disappoints
me sorely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want of manners,&rdquo; corrected Casimir. &ldquo;Heart he
never had. Why, Desprez, for a clever fellow, you are
the most gullible mortal in creation. Your ignorance of
human nature and human business is beyond belief. You
are swindled by heathen Turks, swindled by vagabond
children, swindled right and left, upstairs and downstairs.
I think it must be your imagination. I thank my stars I
have none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; replied Desprez, still humbly, but with
a return of spirit at sight of a distinction to be drawn;
&ldquo;pardon me, Casimir. You possess, even to an eminent
degree, the commercial imagination. It was the lack of
that in me&mdash;it appears it is my weak point&mdash;that has led
to these repeated shocks. By the commercial imagination
the financier forecasts the destiny of his investments,
marks the falling house&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; interrupted Casimir: &ldquo;our friend the stable-boy
appears to have his share of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor was silenced; and the meal was continued
and finished principally to the tune of the brother-in-law&rsquo;s
not very consolatory conversation. He entirely ignored
the two young English painters, turning a blind eyeglass
to their salutations, and continuing his remarks as if he
were alone in the bosom of his family; and with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
second word he ripped another stitch out of the air-balloon
of Desprez&rsquo; vanity. By the time coffee was over the poor
Doctor was as limp as a napkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go and see the ruins,&rdquo; said Casimir.</p>

<p>They strolled forth into the street. The fall of the
house, like the loss of a front tooth, had quite transformed
the village. Through the gap the eye commanded a great
stretch of open snowy country, and the place shrank in
comparison. It was like a room with an open door. The
sentinel stood by the green gate, looking very red and cold,
but he had a pleasant word for the Doctor and his wealthy
kinsman.</p>

<p>Casimir looked at the mound of ruins, he tried the
quality of the tarpaulin. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope the
cellar arch has stood. If it has, my good brother, I will
give you a good price for the wines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall start digging to-morrow,&rdquo; said the sentry.
&ldquo;There is no more fear of snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; returned Casimir sententiously, &ldquo;you
had better wait till you get paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor winced, and began dragging his offensive
brother-in-law towards Tentaillon&rsquo;s. In the house there
would be fewer auditors, and these already in the secret
of his fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried Casimir, &ldquo;there goes the stable-boy
with his luggage; no, egad, he is taking it into the inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And sure enough, Jean-Marie was seen to cross the
snowy street and enter Tentaillon&rsquo;s, staggering under a
large hamper.</p>

<p>The Doctor stopped with a sudden, wild hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can he have?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let us go and see.&rdquo;
And he hurried on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His luggage, to be sure,&rdquo; answered Casimir. &ldquo;He
is on the move&mdash;thanks to the commercial imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen that hamper for&mdash;for ever so long,&rdquo;
remarked the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor will you see it much longer,&rdquo; chuckled Casimir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
&ldquo;unless, indeed, we interfere. And by the way, I insist
on an examination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not require,&rdquo; said Desprez, positively with
a sob; and, casting a moist, triumphant glance at Casimir,
he began to run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil is up with him, I wonder?&rdquo; Casimir
reflected; and then, curiosity taking the upper hand, he
followed the Doctor&rsquo;s example and took to his heels.</p>

<p>The hamper was so heavy and large, and Jean-Marie
himself so little and so weary, that it had taken him a great
while to bundle it upstairs to the Desprez&rsquo; private room;
and he had just set it down on the floor in front of Anastasie,
when the Doctor arrived, and was closely followed by the
man of business. Boy and hamper were both in a most
sorry plight; for the one had passed four months underground
in a certain cave on the way to Ach&egrave;res, and the
other had run about five miles as hard as his legs would
carry him, half that distance under a staggering weight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean-Marie,&rdquo; cried the Doctor, in a voice that was
only too seraphic to be called hysterical, &ldquo;is it&mdash;&mdash;? It
is!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, my son, my son!&rdquo; And he sat down
upon the hamper and sobbed like a little child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not go to Paris now,&rdquo; said Jean-Marie
sheepishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Casimir,&rdquo; said Desprez, raising his wet face, &ldquo;do you
see that boy, that angel boy? He is the thief; he took
the treasure from a man unfit to be entrusted with its use;
he brings it back to me when I am sobered and humbled.
These, Casimir, are the Fruits of my Teaching, and this
moment is the Reward of my Life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tiens</i>,&rdquo; said Casimir.</p>
